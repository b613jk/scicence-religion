Measuring this spatial association captures the implicit metaphorical representations of religious concepts. Previous studies have shown that implicit measurements of the belief in God increase when people are confronted with their own mortality. Here we investigated the effect of mortality salience on implicit metaphorical representations of religiosity. Using a repeated measurement design, we found that implicit associations between God-up and devil-down increase when people think about their own death, but not when they think about a tooth treatment (control condition). The effect was moderated by self-esteem; only people with low and medium self-esteem were influenced by mortality salience. Our results show that mortality salience automatically activates religious contents and their cognitive representations that embody these abstract contents. © 2022 The Author(s).

However, the size of this “gender gap” may depend on the measure of religiosity employed, the religious tradition being sampled, and socio-demographic factors. Here, we conduct a systematic cross-cultural investigation into the prevalence of, and explanations for, the religiosity gender gap in 2,002 individuals from 14 diverse societies. While variation exists across societies, women in general indicate greater mental commitment (i.e., thinking and worrying more about) to their community’s moralistic god, more frequent participation in rituals for their community’s moralistic god, and more frequent prayer. While we find that the gender gap extends beyond the Christian world, no such difference was seen in religious commitment towards more local gods, to which men tend to show greater commitment. Tentative support is provided for explanations relating gender differences in religiosity to lower formal education and greater mentalizing among women, however an explanation for greater religious commitment to local gods among men remains elusive. Nevertheless, our data suggest that the moralizing gods of some contemporary world religions, unlike local deities and traditions, have evolved in ways that make them more appealing to women. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","cross-cultural research; Cultural evolution; moralistic gods; risk; secularization; supernatural punishment",,"Argyle, M., Beit-Hallahmi, B., (1975) The social psychology of religion, , Routledge & K.

However, there is a lack of theorizing and experimental studies regarding the influence of local religions on inter-personal conduct. In the current research, we obtained data on beliefs regarding the moralizing qualities of the Christian god, a local god (Ogum), and police in a sample from Northeastern Brazil (n = 193). We used these beliefs as predictors of behavior in Dictator Games where players distributed endowed money between anonymous individuals belonging to local and distant communities. We used subtle reminders of the Christian god, Ogum, and police to investigate their influence on game behavior. The correlational and priming results are mostly in agreement, revealing that: (a) the Christian god is perceived as most moralizing, but (b) has only limited impact on game behavior, while (c) adherence to Ogum is associated with ingroup favoritism, as is (d) priming with secular authority. These results illustrate the differential effects of belief in moralizing and local deities on extended prosociality but show that in specific contexts, secular authorities may emulate the effects of local rather than moralizing deities. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Brazil; Candomblé; dictator game; economic games; moralizing gods; prosocial behavior; secular authority",,"Ahmed, A., Hammarstedt, M., The effect of subtle religious representations on cooperation (2011) International Journal of Social Economics, 38 (11), pp. 900-910; Ahnen, R.E., The politics of police violence in democratic Brazil (2007) Latin American Politics and Society, 49 (1), pp. 141-164; Amaral, R., (2002) Xirê!: o Modo de Crer e de Viver no Candomblé, , Pallas/EDUC; Atkinson, Q.D., Bourrat, P., Beliefs about God, the afterlife and morality support the role of supernatural policing in human cooperation (2011) Evolution and Human Behavior, 32 (1), pp. 41-49; Barber, N., A cross-national test of the uncertainty hypothesis of religious belief (2011) Cross-Cultural Research, 45 (3), pp. 318-333; Berkenbrock, V.J., (2017), O conceito de ética no candomblé., HORIZONTE-Revista de Estudos de Teologia e Ciências da Religião, 905–928; Caldeira, T.P., The paradox of police violence in democratic Brazil (2002) Ethnography, 3 (3), pp. 235-263; Chalupa, A., Why did Greeks and Romans prayed aloud?

Most assessments, however, employ data sampled at a state-level with a focus on world religions. Using individual-level data collected in societies of varied community sizes with diverse religious traditions including animism, shamanism, polytheism, and monotheism, we conducted a systematic cross-cultural test (N = 1820; 14 societies) of the relationship between material insecurity (indexed by food insecurity) and religious commitment (indexed by both beliefs and practices). Moreover, we examined the relationship between material security and individuals’ commitment to two types of deities (moralistic and local), thus providing the first simultaneous test of the existential security hypothesis across co-existing traditions.

The possibility of social life beyond a face-to-face community exists when supernaturally sanctioned prosocial moral norms include an expanding circle of humanity—that is, when non-kin are treated as kin. This paper describes an effort to gain a clearer picture of the ways in which belief in a moralistic deity affects people’s behavior toward others, including distant coreligionists and faraway strangers, using Dictator Game (DG) play among the Sursurunga of New Ireland, Papua New Guinea. The DG experiments employed two conditions: a Local God condition and a Big God condition. Two predictions were made about the recipients of greater allocations of money in the Big God condition: (1) a distant coreligionist over a member of one’s kin group, and (2) a faraway stranger over a distant coreligionist. A final prediction was that (3) all allocations to oneself would be lower in the Big God condition than in the Local God condition. Only predictions (2) and (3) were supported by the results. An unexpected and surprising outcome was that after playing DG, participants who kept more for themselves tended to view God as less moralistic and less punitive. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","cognitive dissonance; Dictator Game; inequality aversion; moralistic and punitive deity; priming; sursurunga; watchful deity",,"Atkinson, Q.D., Bourrat, P., Beliefs about God, the afterlife and morality support the role of supernatural policing in human cooperation (2011) Evolution and Human Behavior, 12 (1), pp. 141-149; Barr, A.M., Ensminger, J., Henrich, J., Wallace, C., Barrett, H.C., Bolyanatz, A., Ziker, J., (2009), …,).

Here, we use data on religious beliefs and practices, religious priming, and four versions of a dictator game at two sites—one predominantly Christian and one predominantly Kastom—to test a suite of hypotheses linking prosocial behavior to beliefs about and commitment to both a powerful moralistic god and a less morally concerned local supernatural force. We found belief that the moralistic god was more punitive did not predict increased giving towards co-religionists but did predict giving more to a religious outgroup member over a co-religionist. Belief that the moralistic god was more rewarding predicted less giving towards a distant coreligionist or outgroup member. Religious commitment predicted giving to a distant coreligionist over someone from one's own village. We did not find any effect of beliefs about and commitment to less morally-concerned local supernatural forces on giving. We also did not find the predicted effects of religious priming on giving. These findings suggest a more complex relationship between religious beliefs and prosocial behavior than current theory can accommodate. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","cooperation; deity; god; prosocial; Religion; supernatural punishment; Vanuatu",,"Alcorta, C.S., Sosis, R., Ritual, emotion, and sacred symbols (2005) Human Nature, 16 (4), pp. 323-359; Atkinson, Q.D., Religion and expanding the cooperative sphere in Kastom and Christian villages on Tanna, Vanuatu (2017) Religion, Brain & Behavior, pp. 1-19; Atkinson, Q.D., Bourrat, P., Beliefs about God, the afterlife and morality support the role of supernatural policing in human cooperation (2011) Evolution and Human Behavior, 32 (1), pp. 41-49; Atkinson, Q.D., Latham, A.J., Watts, J., Are big gods a big deal in the emergence of big groups?

In contrast, Hindu deities are considered aspects of one god, and urban regions include LGs, complicating the prevailing distinction. The current study investigated perceptions of deities in Mysore, India, among Hindus (N = 165) who primarily worship Shiva, a prototypical MG, and Chamundeshwari, the LG. Using surveys and experimental games, our results indicated that Chamundeshwari is perceived as possessing characteristics typical of both LGs and MGs. Furthermore, beliefs about Shiva as a moralizing and punitive god were associated with prosocial game allocations in three experimental economic games, but similar beliefs about Chamundeshwari were not. Participation in rituals for Shiva predicted allocations toward outgroup members in one game, whereas participation in rituals for Chamundeshwari predicted selfish allocations in one game. These mixed results demonstrate the challenges that demographic and cultural variation can impose on dichotomous models of deities to explain religious variation, and we offer directions for future research to better understand such complexity. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","economic games; India; moralizing gods; Religion; supernatural punishment",,"Ahmad, T.J., Murthy, K., Impact of demographic and areal changes on urban growth: A case study of Mysore City (2012) International Journal of Technical and Physical Problems of Engineering (IJTPE), 10 (4), pp. 74-79; Andersen, S., Ertaç, S., Gneezy, U., Hoffman, M., List, J.A., Stakes matter in ultimatum games (2011) American Economic Review, 101 (7), pp. 3427-3439; Aveyard, M.E., A call to honesty: Extending religious priming of moral behavior to Middle Eastern Muslims (2014) PloS One, 9 (7); Beheim, B., Atkinson, Q., Bulbulia, J., Gervais, W.M., Gray, R., Henrich, J., Lang, M., Willard, A., (2019), Corrected analyses show that moralizing gods precede complex societies but serious data concerns remain; Bering, J.M., McLeod, K., Shackelford, T.K., Reasoning about dead agents reveals possible adaptive trends (2005) Human Nature, 16 (4), pp. 360-381; Boehm, C., A biocultural evolutionary exploration of supernatural sanctioning (2008) Evolution of Religion: Studies, Theories, and Critiques, pp. 143-152; (2011), http://censusindia.gov.in/2011-common/censusdataonline.html?drpQuick=%26drpQuickSelect=%26q=jenukuruba, Census of India: Census Data Online; Dumont, L., (1970) A structural definition of a folk deity of Tamil Nad: Aiyanar, the lord, pp. 20-32. , Mouton; Ensminger, J., Transaction costs and Islam: Explaining conversion in Africa (1997) Journal of Institutional and Theoretical Economics (JITE)/Zeitschrift für die gesamte Staatswissenschaft, pp. 4-29; Evans-Pritchard, E.E., The Nuer conception of spirit in its relation to the social order (1953) American Anthropologist, 55 (2), pp. 201-214. , http://www.jstor.org/stable/664587; Evans-Pritchard, S.E., (1940) The Nuer: a description of the modes of livelihood and the Political Institutions of a nilotic people, , Oxford University Press; Flood, G.D., (1996) An introduction to Hinduism, , Cambridge University Press; Fuller Christopher, J., (1992) The camphor flame, , Princeton: Princeton University Press; Hartshorne, C., (1964) Man’s vision of God and the logic of theism, , Archon Books; Henrich, J., Ensminger, J., McElreath, R., Barr, A., Barrett, C., Bolyanatz, A., Ziker, J., Markets, religion, community size, and the evolution of fairness and punishment (2010) Science, 327 (5972), pp. 1480-1484. , …; Hruschka, D., Efferson, C., Jiang, T., Falletta-Cowden, A., Sigurdsson, S., McNamara, R., Sands, M., Henrich, J., Impartial institutions, pathogen stress and the expanding social network (2014) Human Nature, 25 (4), pp. 567-579; Hruschka, D.J., Henrich, J., Institutions, parasites and the persistence of in-group preferences (2013) PLOS ONE, 8 (5); Irons, W., Religion as a hard-to-fake sign of commitment (2001) Evolution and the capacity for commitment, pp. 290-309. , Nesse R.M., (ed), Russell Sage Foundation,.

Congo who were unsure if they would be able to provide sufficient food for their families gave more of their money away to anonymous receivers in behavioral games. They were especially likely to share money evenly. We argue that this surprising prosocial behavior reflects sharing norms associated with informal insurance, for which more materially insecure individuals presumably have higher demand. We further argue that such sharing norms are sustained in urban Congo by Pentecostal churches, a nexus of risk-spreading in this context. The same group of highly insecure individuals is more likely to participate in public religious ceremonies—but not private ones—and to share money evenly in behavioral games. Moreover, the gap in money sharing between individuals facing high and low insecurity is largest when participants are primed with Christian images. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Congo; informal insurance; Pentecostalism; Prosociality",,"Achtziger, A., Alós-Ferrer, C., Wagner, A.K., Money, depletion, and prosociality in the dictator game (2015) Journal of Neuroscience, Psychology, and Economics, 8 (1), p. 1; Auriol, E., Diego, D., Fourati, M., Miquel-Florensa, J., Seabright, P., (2019), Betting on the lord: Lotteries and religiosity haiti, [Working Paper]; Auriol, E., Lassebie, J., Panin, A., Raiber, E., Seabright, P., (2017), God insures those who pay?

Cultural group selection proposes a possible answer to this puzzle—cooperative norms and institutions proliferate due to group-level benefits. For instance, belief in knowledgeable, moralizing deities is theorized to decrease selfishness and favoritism through threat of supernatural punishment. Similarly, norms of fairness and cooperation are theorized to have coevolved with engagement in markets, which necessitate anonymous exchanges. We investigate these theories among the Tanzanian Hadza who, until recently, have had minimal exposure to markets or major world religions. Engagement with Western tourists, village markets, and Christian missionaries is increasingly leading researchers to ask how such interactions have affected cooperative behavior. We interviewed 172 Hadza from 15 camps varying in market proximity, and measured cooperative decision-making using economic games. We find that exposure to missionaries is associated with increased belief in a knowledgeable and punitive deity, with mixed evidence that these beliefs, in turn, affect game play. In contrast, we find some evidence that those living in market-adjacent regions exhibit less in-group favoritism when cooperating. These results support the claim that market-norms, and to some degree religious beliefs, facilitate greater cooperation and fairness in social interactions. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Cooperation; cultural evolution; Hadza; hunter-gatherers; market norms; religion",,"Apicella, C.L., High levels of rule-bending in a minimally religious and largely egalitarian forager population (2018) Religion, Brain & Behavior, 8 (2), pp. 133-148; Apicella, C.L., Azevedo, E.M., Christakis, N.A., Fowler, J.H., Evolutionary origins of the endowment effect: Evidence from hunter-gatherers (2014) American Economic Review, 104 (6), pp. 1793-1805; Apicella, C.L., Crittenden, A.N., Tobolsky, V.A., Evolution and human behavior hunter-gatherer males are more risk-seeking than females, even in late childhood (2017) Evolution and Human Behavior, 38 (5), pp. 592-603; Apicella, C.L., Silk, J.B., The evolution of human cooperation (2019) Current Biology, 29 (11), pp. R447-R450; Bala, G.G., (1998) Hadza stories & songs, , Friends of the Hadzabe; Becker, G.S., (1957) The economics of discrimination, , University of Chicago press; Berbesque, J., Marlowe, F.W., Sex differences in food preferences of Hadza hunter-gatherers (2009) Evolutionary Psychology, 7 (4), pp. 601-616; Berbesque, J.C., Wood, B.M., Crittenden, A.N., Mabulla, A., Marlowe, F.W., Eat first, share later: Hadza Hunter-gatherer men consume more while foraging than in central places (2016) Evolution and Human Behavior, 37 (4), pp. 281-286; Bihariová, E., Herdu, N.J., Avoiding Christianity–a weapon in educating ‘savage’ pastoralists: A case study of Nilotic Buradiga in Tanzania (2016) Asian and African Studies, 25 (1), pp. 85-105; Bleek, D.F., The Hadzapi or Watindega of Tanganyika territory (1931) Africa, 4 (3), pp. 273-286; Blurton Jones, N.B., Why do so few Hadza farm?

However, during previous pandemics, some religious leaders also undermined public-health measures. Thus, it is important to understand what religious leaders think of the expectations of health organizations, as well as their responses to the pandemic. This study explored church leaders’ role perception and action towards COVID-19 in Nigeria. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with eighteen church leaders from Catholic, Anglican, and Pentecostal churches. Using a thematic analysis method, the study found that while all the participants agreed to have roles in the campaign against COVID-19, interpretations of these roles and the corresponding actions differed between those who promote public-health measures and those who undermine these measures. Implications of findings for policy and research are discussed. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","action; church leaders; COVID-19; Nigeria; religious leaders; role perception; WHO",,"(2021), https://www.anglicannews.org/news/2021/03/archbishop-of-nigeria-urges-nigerians-to-receive-covid-19-vaccine.aspx, Archbishop of Nigeria urges Nigerians to receive Covid-19 vaccine,.

However, the effects of beliefs related to local supernatural agents have not been extensively explored. Drawing from a Mauritian Hindu sample, we investigated the effects of beliefs and practices related to two different types of local supernatural agents (spirits of the deceased unconcerned with morality) on preferential resources allocation to receivers differing in geographical and social closeness to participants. These spirits are ambiguously linked to either ancestor worship or sorcery practice. Previous studies suggested that sorcery beliefs erode social bonds and trust, but such research is often limited by social stigma and missing relevant comparison with other beliefs. To overcome these limitations, we used nuanced free-list data to discriminate between the two modes of spirit beliefs and tested how each contributes to decision-making in economic games (Random Allocation, Dictator). Expressing sorcery beliefs together with performing rituals addressed to the spirits was associated with greater probability of rule-breaking for selfish/parochial outcomes in the Random Allocation Game (compared to ancestor worship). No difference in money allocations was found in the Dictator Game. © 2022 The Author(s).

One mechanism underlying this association could be a cognitive bias toward generally attributing moral concern to anthropomorphic agents. If humans cognitively represent the minds of deities and humans in the same way, and if human agents are generally conceptualized as having moral concern, a broad tendency to attribute moral concern—a “moralization bias”—to supernatural deities follows. Using data from 2,228 individuals in 15 different field sites, we test for the existence of such a bias. We find that people are indeed more likely than chance to indicate that local deities care about punishing theft, murder, and deceit. This effect is stable even after holding beliefs about explicitly moralistic deities constant. Additionally, we take a close look at data collected among Hadza foragers and find two of their deities to be morally interested. There is no evidence to suggest that this effect is due to direct missionary contact. We posit that the “moralization bias of gods’ minds” is part of a widespread but variable religious phenotype, and a candidate mechanism that contributes to the well-recognized association between religion and cooperation. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","cognitive science of religion; gods’ minds; morality; Supernatural punishment",,"Alexander, R.D., (1987) The biology of moral systems, , Aldine Transaction; Apicella, C.L., High levels of rule-bending in a minimally religious and largely egalitarian forager population (2018) Religion, Brain & Behavior, 8 (2), pp. 133-148; Atkinson, Q.D., Bourrat, P., Beliefs about God, the afterlife and morality support the role of supernatural policing in human cooperation (2011) Evolution and Human Behavior, 32 (1), pp. 41-49; Baron-Cohen, S., (1995) Mindblindness: An essay on autism and theory of mind, , The MIT Press; Baron-Cohen, S., Wheelwright, S., The empathy quotient: An investigation of adults with asperger syndrome or high functioning autism, and normal sex differences (2004) Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 34 (2), pp. 163-175; Baron-Cohen, S., Wheelwright, S., Hill, J., Raste, Y., Plumb, I., The “reading the mind in the eyes” test revised version: A study with normal adults, and adults with asperger syndrome or high-functioning autism (2001) Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 42 (2), pp. 241-251; Barrett, A.J., (1989), Sacrifice and prophecy Turkana cosmology [Doctoral dissertation].

Recent research indicates they can powerfully affect social connection, increasing collective sentiments and behaviors. However, the extent to which these effects depend on religious commitment remains unclear. Here, we use longitudinal data to investigate this question in a natural ritual setting by comparing the responses of religiously committed Hindus and non-Hindus immediately after a public Diwali celebration in New Zealand, and for two weeks following. Effects of time and level of religious commitment are assessed on five targets that measure reported social connection of participants to themselves and to specific groups: “Myself,” “My family and friends,” “Work colleagues/university peers,” “People who celebrate Diwali,” and “Humanity in general.” We find that participation in the civic religious ritual affects social connection of all participants, with stronger effects among religiously committed Hindus. Private religious behavior appears integral to the mechanisms underpinning the amplification of solidarity at public rituals, as we find separation in the level of reported social connection to Diwali celebrants between practicing and non-practicing Hindus. Though religious commitment leads to greater perceived social connection, this study additionally demonstrates that in a religiously diverse democracy, a civic religious ritual may foster greater democratic unions across religious differences. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","democracy; Diwali; longitudinal; religion; religious diversity; ritual; social cognition",,"http://www.aucklandnz.com/diwali/about-diwali, Aucklandnz.com.

In this paper, I formalize sympathetic magical action and offer a naturalistic explanation of manipulative sympathetic magic by attributing it to a combination of environmental regularities (i.e., things that are similar and/or physically proximate tend to co-vary) and human causal cognition (i.e., the tendency to mistake correlation as causation), and supply ample ethnographic and historical evidence for my arguments. In doing so I also specify the variables involved and re-classify sympathetic magic into four distinct types for analytic convenience. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","causal cognition; evolutionary psychology; spatial autocorrelation; Sympathetic magic",,"Abbott, K.R., Sherratt, T.N., The evolution of superstition through optimal use of incomplete information (2011) Animal Behaviour, 82 (1), pp. 85-92; Andersen, M., Predictive coding in agency detection (2019) Religion, Brain and Behavior, 9 (1), pp. 65-84; Anderson, J.R., Myowa-Yamakoshi, M., Matsuzawa, T., Contagious yawning in chimpanzees (2004) Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 271, pp. S468-S470; Armitage, N., European and African figural ritual magic: The beginnings of the voodoo doll myth (2015) The materiality of magic: An artifactual investigation into ritual practices and popular beliefs, pp. 85-100. , Houlbrook C., Armitage N., (eds), Oxbow Books,.

The result of multilevel level logistic regression reveals that religious Muslims are more likely to visit religious healers than non-religious Muslims. Individuals who believe in the supernatural (i.e., evil eye, witchcraft) and that making offerings to them is acceptable in Islam are more likely to visit religious healers than others. Also, a moderation effect indicates these same people are more likely to visit religious healers than religious individuals who do not believe in such supernatural forces. Individuals from lower economic strata and rural areas, females, and non-educated people are more likely to visit religious healers than others. This is the first quantitative study on determinants of people's visitation to religious healers. Limitations and practical implications of the study are also discussed. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Islam; public health; quantitative analysis; Religiosity; religious healers; supernatural belief",,"Ahmed, I., Bremer, J., Magzoub, M., Nouri, A., Characteristics of visitors to traditional healers in central Sudan (1999) Eastern Mediterranean Health Journal, 5 (1), pp. 79-85; Altınoğlu, E., Religious commitment or a textualist-traditionalist understanding of Islam?

I searched the Web of Science Core Collection on Nov 22, 2020 for studies published between 2000 and 2020 with the term “ritual*” in the title, keywords or abstract. A data corpus of 16,600 English-language publications was further analysed using publication statistics, citation metrics, co-citation networks and network analyses of keywords. Evolutionary research on religious ritual with an emphasis on signaling was identified as a central area of research with strong impact on the study of ritual overall. Distinct clusters of clinical, neuroscience, developmental and health research using rituals were also identified and these clusters showed high citation metrics. Concerning publication outlets, archaeology journals publish a large number of papers on ritual, but the impact of these publications as measured by citations weakens over time. Changes in research trends suggest a maturation and specialization of ritualistic research over the last 20 years, with greater isolation and disconnectedness of individual research themes. The list of key publications based on contemporary impact metrics and historical co-citation networks can be used to provide a common language and theoretical lens for researchers to facilitate interaction between different disciplines. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","archaeology; bibliometrics; evolution; network analysis; religion; research analytics; Ritual",,"Allard, F., Erdenebaatar, D., Khirigsuurs, ritual and mobility in the Bronze age of Mongolia (2005) Antiquity, 79 (305), pp. 547-563; Anand, N., Watson, M., Tournament rituals in the evolution of fields: The case of the Grammy Awards (2004) Academy of Management Journal, 47 (1), pp. 59-80; Anschuetz, K., Wilshusen, R., Scheick, C., An archaeology of landscapes: Perspectives and directions (2001) Journal of Archaeological Research, 9 (2), pp. 157-211; Aria, M., Cuccurullo, C., Bibliometrix: An R-tool for comprehensive science mapping analysis (2017) Journal of Informetrics, 11 (4), pp. 959-975; Arksey, H., O’Malley, L., Scoping studies: Towards a methodological framework (2005) International Journal of Social Research Methodology, 8 (1), pp. 19-32; Atran, S., Norenzayan, A., Religion’s evolutionary landscape: Counterintuition, commitment, compassion, communion (2004) Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 27 (6), p. 713; Bastian, B., Jetten, J., Hornsey, M.J., Leknes, S., The positive consequences of pain: A biopsychosocial approach (2014) Personality and Social Psychology Review, 18 (3), pp. 256-279; Baughman, T., Elemental mercury spills (2006) Environmental Health Perspectives, 114 (2), pp. 147-152; Beaulieu, L., (2015), https://lucbeaulieu.com/2015/11/19/how-many-citations-are-actually-a-lot-of-citations/, November 20,How many citations are actually a lot of citations?

It is also potentially informative about religious interpretations of negative events (e.g., that they are part of God’s benevolent plan). Yet, it is not clear what cognitive mechanism(s) might link negative events to religious belief, and what motivates belief in gods that cause these events. We proposed that a repressive coping style is an important factor because it involves an interpretive bias that both downplays threat and also emphasizes benefits afforded by ambivalent stimuli (including god concepts), potentially facilitating the construction of supernatural concepts that are positive and relevant enough to attract and sustain belief. In the current research, across three studies, we found that repressors were more likely to be religious, and more likely to interpret familiar, unfamiliar, and experimenter-created gods positively. Repression partially explained the positive views of gods held by religious individuals, and this relationship strengthened when distressing events were associated with gods, suggesting that repression helps to sustain belief. Furthermore, the relationship between repression and belief in familiar and unfamiliar gods was partially explained by god positivity, supporting a motivated reasoning account of belief formation. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","ambivalence; interpretive bias; motivated reasoning; negative events; Religious belief; repression; supernatural agents",,"Abdel-Khalek, A.M., Nuño, L., Gómez-Benito, J., Lester, D., The relationship between religiosity and anxiety: A meta-analysis (2019) Journal of Religion and Health, 58 (5), pp. 1847-1856; Atran, S., Norenzayan, A., Religion’s evolutionary landscape: Counterintuition, commitment, compassion, communion (2004) Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 27 (6), pp. 713-770; Barrett, J.L., (2004) Why would anyone believe in God?, , AltaMira Press; Barrett, J.L., Coding and quantifying counterintuitiveness in religious concepts: Theoretical and methodological reflections (2008) Method and Theory in the Study of Religion, 20 (4), pp. 308-338; Bentzen, J.S., (2013), http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2221859, Origins of religiousness: The role of natural disasters.

However, mentalizing can be broken down into several components, and there are certain measures that correspond to such components. This study aimed to examine the relationship between mentalizing and religious belief using two representative measures, the Empathy Quotient (EQ) and the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test (RMET). The results of two studies with Japanese samples showed that the EQ predicted increasing religious belief (study 1), as expected. However, the RMET was not a significant predictor of religious belief (studies 1 and 2). These findings suggest that mentalizing’s mental state attribution component (i.e., matching appropriate mental state words to facial expressions in the eye region) is not directly connected to religious belief. However, the motivational component (i.e., caring about what other people think and feel) is essential for believing in supernatural agents. This study’s limitations and directions for future studies are also discussed. © 2021 The Author(s).

We used the tools of virtual reality (VR) to explore the effects of active imagination in creating a sense of presence of an ambiguously real other. We found that adding a visual representation was more effective than verbal language alone in evoking a sense of social presence in a ten-minute intervention, that a proclivity for absorption enhanced the sense of social and environmental presence, and that a sense of social presence was associated with a sense of responsive interaction. We present our data together with a critical analysis of the literature on perceptual presence and conclude by suggesting that presence is best understood as the product of a collaboration between a perceiving subject and the environment within which they are embedded. This study serves as an example of a novel approach that bridges different scientific literatures, methods, and disciplines to study religious experience. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","prayer; Presence; religious studies; social presence; virtual reality",,"Ahn, S.J., (2011) Embodied experiences in immersive virtual environments: Effects on pro-environmental attitude and behavior, , Stanford University; Andersen, M., Predictive coding in agency detection (2019) Religion, Brain & Behavior, 9 (1), pp. 65-84; Andersen, M., Pfeiffer, T., Müller, S., Schjoedt, U., Agency detection in predictive minds: A virtual reality study (2019) Religion, Brain & Behavior, 9 (1), pp. 52-64; Bailenson, J.N., Beall, A.C., Blascovich, J., Raimundo, M., Weisbuch, M., Intelligent agents who wear your face: Users’ reactions to the virtual self (2001) International workshop on intelligent virtual agents, pp. 86-99. , September,Springer, &,.

These two dimensions of doctrinal religion are thought to be a product of divergent patterns of learning and cultural transmission. It is common for the official representatives of doctrinal religions to portray the unauthorized practices of little traditions pejoratively as amoral superstitions. Here, we consider an alternative theory, that great and little traditions are a product of distinct forms of cooperation: the one focused on loyalty to large-scale categories evolving via cultural group selection, the other focused on advancing the interests of kin-based relational ties evolving via intra-group selection. To investigate this theory further, we carried out a series of studies with followers of great and little traditions within Burmese Theravada Buddhism, showing overall that great tradition affiliation involves stronger alignment with categorical large-scale groups, while little tradition affiliation involves stronger alignments with relational kin-based groups. We propose an empirically-grounded general theory of the evolutionary processes and psychological mechanisms underlying the bifurcation between great and little traditions in the world’s doctrinal religions. © 2021 The Author(s).

However, these findings come largely out of the USA and have focused on intended rather than real prosocial behavior. We propose a contextual model of the awe-prosociality relationship predicated on the constructed theory of emotion, according to which emotion categories and cost–benefit analyses of possible subsequent actions differ across cultures and in line with enduring individual differences. To test the model, we conducted a laboratory study (N = 143) examining whether costly volunteering behavior is higher amid awe in the Czech Republic, a country where social psychological studies have often produced different results compared to the USA. Awe-inspiring and neutral primes were validated in pilot studies (N = 229). As is possible under the contextual model, awe-inspiring primes elicited not more, but less, prosocial behavior, with the relationship being moderated by various facets of Openness to Experience. Individuals higher in the Feelings facet of Openness were also found to be more awe-prone. A call is made for a cross-cultural investigation of the awe-behavior relationship that accounts for complex phylogenetic relationships between cultures. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Awe; constructed emotion; cooperation; culture; Openness to Experience; small self",,"Ahn, W., Kim, N.S., Lassaline, M.E., Dennis, M.J., Causal status as a determinant of feature centrality (2001) Cognitive Psychology, 41 (4), pp. 361-416; Aluja, A., García, Ó., García, L.F., Relationships among extraversion, openness to experience, and sensation seeking (2003) Personality and Individual Differences, 35 (3), pp. 671-680; Anderson, L.R., DiTraglia, F.J., Gerlach, J.R., Measuring altruism in a public goods experiment: A comparison of U.S. and Czech subjects (2011) Experimental Economics, 14 (3), pp. 426-437; Aranyosi, E.F., Wasteful advertising and variance reduction: Darwinian models for the significance of nonutilitarian architecture (1999) Journal of Anthropological Archaeology, 18 (3), pp. 356-375; Ashby, F.G., Maddox, W.T., Stimulus categorization (1998) Handbook of perception and cognition, pp. 251-301. , Birnbaum M.H., (ed), 2nd ed., Academic Press, &,.

Despite some researchers’ claims that ancestor worship was once universal, there have been relatively few attempts to explain how and why this behavior became so prominent in unrelated and geographically separated societies. A notable exception is the descendant-leaving strategy model that claims ancestor worship is a traditional strategy that had the effect of influencing the behavior of multiple generations of descendants of a common ancestor. This model describes the function of ancestor worship as promoting altruism and cooperation among descendants, even those who are only distantly related. Here we reframe the descendant-leaving strategy theory of ancestor worship in terms of fitness interdependence. In other words, ancestor worship is a descendant-leaving strategy that can explain interesting patterns of fitness interdependence, namely, ancestor-descendant and intergenerational cooperation, which led to the persistence of ancestor worship. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","altruism; Ancestor worship; cooperation; fitness interdependence; kinship; traditions",,"Akçay, E., Van Cleve, J., There is no fitness but fitness, and the lineage is its bearer (2016) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 371 (1687), p. 20150085; Aktipis, A., Cronk, L., Alcock, J., Ayers, J.D., Baciu, C., Balliet, D., Boddy, A.M., Winfrey, P., Understanding cooperation through fitness interdependence (2018) Nature Human Behaviour, 2 (7), pp. 429-431; Alexander, R.D., (1979) Darwinism and human affairs, , University of Washington; Aron, A., Aron, E.N., Smollan, D., Inclusion of other in the self scale and the structure of interpersonal closeness (1992) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 63 (4), pp. 596-612; Balliet, D., Tybur, J.M., Van Lange, P.A., Functional interdependence theory: An evolutionary account of social situations (2017) Personality and Social Psychology Review, 21 (4), pp. 361-388; Berscheid, E., Snyder, M., Omoto, A.M., The relationship Closeness inventory: Assessing the closeness of interpersonal relation- ships (1989) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 57 (5), pp. 792-807; Borgerhoff Mulder, M., Optimizing offspring: The quantity–quality tradeoff in agropastoral kipsigis (2000) Evolution and Human Behavior, 21 (6), pp. 391-410; Boyd, R., Richerson, P.J., (1985) Culture and the evolutionary process, , University of Chicago press; Cavalli-Sforza, L.L., Feldman, M.W., (1981) Cultural transmission and evolution: A quantitative approach, , Princeton University Press; Chapais, B., (2009) Primeval kinship: How pair-bonding gave birth to human society, , Harvard University Press; Chapais, B., From chimpanzee society to human society: Bridging the kinship gap (2017) Chimpanzees and human evolution, pp. 427-463. , Muller M.N., Wrangham R.W., Pilbeam D.R., (eds), Belknap Press of Harvard University Press,.

The current literature suggests that in order to create opposing aftereffects, the two categories must (1) be perceptually distinct and (2) represent distinct meaningfully social categories. The current study was designed to test whether religion is one of the types of social categories that can support the formation of opposing aftereffects. Experiment 1 reports the creation and validation of a Christian and Muslim face set, demonstrating that the religious membership of the face images is visually identifiable. In experiment 2 we attempted to create opposing aftereffects by having adult participants fixate on Christian and Muslim faces that were expanded and contracted. Participants either heard religious membership explicit or control audio recordings. Opposing aftereffects were observed only when Christian and Muslim faces were explicitly labeled. In experiment 3, eight-year-olds were adapted to a similar paradigm, with explicit religious information provided. Opposing aftereffects were not observed. Results of these experiments suggest that for adults, religion might be the kind of meaningful social category required for the formation of opposing aftereffects, but only if religious category membership is made explicit. Eight-year-old children's understanding of religious categories may still be developing. © 2021 The Author(s).

Moreover, the literature has not examined distinct psychological accounts of this relationship. We tested the replicability of the correlation (N = 5284; students and broader samples of Canadians, Americans, and Indians); while testing three accounts of how cognitive style comes to be related to belief in God, karma, witchcraft, and to the belief that religion is necessary for morality. The first, the dual process model, posits that analytical thinking is recruited in overriding intuitions related to supernatural beliefs. The second, the expressive rationality model, posits that analytical thinking is recruited in supporting already-held beliefs in an identity-protective manner. And the third, the counter-normativity rationality model, posits that analytical thinking is recruited to question beliefs supported by prevailing cultural norms. In Study 2, we tested the replicability of our results in a re-analysis of published data. The association between analytic thinking style and beliefs was replicated. We conclude that whereas the counter-normativity rationality model was contradicted by the data, both the dual process and expressive rationality models received varying degrees of empirical support, but neither model fully accounted for all the patterns in the data. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","analytical thinking; belief; intuition; Religion",,"Atran, S., Norenzayan, A., Religion’s evolutionary landscape: Counterintuition, commitment, compassion, communion (2004) Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 27 (6), pp. 713-730; Baimel, A., (2019) Reasoning about the supernatural: A cross-cultural examination of how and when intuitions shape belief, , University of British Columbia; Banerjee, K., Bloom, P., Would Tarzan believe in God?

However, underlying mechanisms are debated and longitudinal evidence is scarce. We use eight years of longitudinal population-representative data from New Zealand to test whether consistent church attendance translates into sustained reductions in distress. We also investigate whether church attendance disrupts dynamic bi-directional relationships between the personality trait of Neuroticism and distress: relationships such as at least temporary increases in Neuroticism following escalations in distress. We compare mental distress trajectories and dynamic effects across three groups of religious people (3,535 non-attenders at church, 1,656 sporadic attenders, and 2,393 consistent attenders), controlling for the effects of gender, age, relative deprivation, and perceived physical health. We observe a more adaptive (downward) mental distress trajectory among consistent attenders as compared to non-attenders, although consistent attenders were also found to have higher baseline levels of mental distress. Among sporadic attenders, we observe elevated baseline distress levels without a decrease in mental distress over time, suggesting that the differences in the trajectories of consistent attenders and non-attenders cannot be explained solely by regression to the mean. Church attendance consistency did not modulate dynamic effects. The findings point to a role for church attendance in buffering stress specifically among people in difficult (distressing) circumstances. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","church; deprivation; distress; growth trajectory; longitudinal; mental health; Neuroticism; Religion",,"Atkinson, J., Salmond, C., Crampton, P., (2014) NZDep2013 index of deprivation, , University of Otago; Barefoot, J.C., Schroll, M., Symptoms of depression, acute myocardial infarction, and total mortality in a community sample (1996) Circulation, 93 (11), pp. 1976-1980; Barnett, A.G., van der Pols, J.C., Dobson, A.J., Regression to the mean: What it is and how to deal with it (2005) International Journal of Epidemiology, 34 (1), pp. 215-220; Berry, D., Willoughby, M.T., On the practical interpretability of cross-lagged panel models: Rethinking a developmental workhorse (2017) Child Development, 88 (4), pp. 1186-1206; Bland, J.M., Altman, D.G., Statistics notes: Regression towards the mean (1994) BMJ, 308 (6942), p. 1499; Blazer, D., Palmore, E., Religion and aging in a longitudinal panel (1976) The Gerontologist, 16 (1), pp. 82-85; Bolger, N., Zuckerman, A., A framework for studying personality in the stress process (1995) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 69 (5), pp. 890-902; Braam, A.W., Hein, E., Deeg, D.J.H., Twisk, J.W.R., Beekman, A.T.F., Van Tilburg, W., Religious involvement and 6-year course of depressive symptoms in older Dutch citizens: Results from the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam (2004) Journal of Aging and Health, 16 (4), pp. 467-489; Caspi, A., Houts, R.M., Belsky, D.W., Goldman-Mellor, S.J., Harrington, H., Israel, S., Meier, M.H., Moffitt, T.E., The p factor: One general psychopathology factor in the structure of psychiatric disorders?

In the present study, we sought to expand on past research by examining the relationship between the need for meaning and both traditional religiosity and paranormal beliefs. Does the need for meaning predict paranormal beliefs when controlling for other predictors? We observed that the need for meaning uniquely predicts both religiosity and paranormal beliefs. Considering that traditional religious beliefs and affiliations are in decline in the United States and paranormal beliefs may be increasing, these results have potentially important implications for health and well-being. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","meaning in life; need for meaning; paranormal beliefs; Religion",,"Abeyta, A.A., Routledge, C., The need for meaning and religiosity: An individual differences approach to assessing existential needs and the relation with religious commitment, beliefs, and experiences (2018) Personality and Individual Differences, 123, pp. 6-13; Baumeister, R.F., Leary, M.R., The need to belong: Desire for interpersonal attachments as a fundamental human motivation (1995) Psychological Bulletin, 117 (3), pp. 497-529; Bennett, M.R., Einolf, C.J., Religion, altruism, and helping strangers: A multilevel analysis of 126 countries (2017) Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 56 (2), pp. 323-341; Brassai, L., Piko, B.F., Steger, M.F., A reason to stay healthy: The role of meaning in life in relation to physical activity and healthy eating among adolescents (2015) Journal of Health Psychology, 20 (5), pp. 473-482; Brassai, L., Piko, B.P., Steger, M.F., Meaning in life: Is it a protective factor for adolescents’ psychological health?

First, explanation theories portray religious reasoning as arising for explaining salient aspects of reality. Second, motivation theories interpret religious reasoning as driven by other motives, for example fostering community bonding. Both approaches have provided fundamental insight, yet whether they can be reconciled remains unclear. To address this, I propose a unifying computational theory of religious reasoning expressed in mathematical terms. Although a mathematical approach has been rarely applied to study religion, its advantage is describing a phenomenon clearly and formally. Relying on a Bayesian decision framework, the model comprises three key elements: prior beliefs, novel evidence, and utility. The first two describe the processes classically interpreted by explanation theories, while utility captures phenomena highlighted by motivation theories. By reconciling explanation and motivation theories, this proposal offers a unifying computational picture of religious reasoning. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Bayesian; computational modeling; decision theory; motivation; religion",,"Abelson, R.P., Psychological status of the script concept (1981) American Psychologist, 36 (7), p. 715. , https://doi.org/10.1037/0003-066X.36.7.715; Andersen, M., Predictive coding in agency detection (2019) Religion, Brain & Behavior, 9 (1), pp. 65-84. , https://doi.org/10.1080/2153599X.2017.1387170; Argyle, M., (2006) Religious behaviour, , Routledge; Atran, S., (2002) In gods we trust: The evolutionary landscape of religion, , Oxford University Press; Atran, S., Norenzayan, A., Religion's evolutionary landscape: Counterintuition, commitment, compassion, communion (2004) Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 27 (6), pp. 713-730. , https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X04000172; Barrett, J.L., Exploring the natural foundations of religion (2000) Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 4 (1), pp. 29-34. , https://doi.org/10.1016/S1364-6613(99)01419-9; Batson, C.D., Schoenrade, P., Ventis, W.L., (1993) Religion and the individual: A social-psychological perspective, , Oxford University Press; Baumeister, R.F., (1991) Meanings of life, , Guilford; Baumeister, R.F., Leary, M.R., The need to belong: Desire for interpersonal attachments as a fundamental human motivation (1995) Psychological Bulletin, 117 (3), pp. 497-529. , https://doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.117.3.497; Bialecki, J., (2017) A Diagram for Fire: Miracles and variation in an American charismatic movement (Vol. 21), , University of California Press; Bishop, C.M., (2006) Pattern recognition and machine learning., , Springer; Bloom, P., Religion, morality, evolution (2012) Annual Review of Psychology, 63 (1), pp. 179-199. , https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-psych-120710-100334; Bloom, P., Religion is natural (2007) Developmental Science, 10 (1), pp. 147-151. , https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-7687.2007.00577.x; Boyer, P., (2001) Religion explained: The evolutionary origins of religious thought, , Basic Books; Bowlby, J., (1969) Attachment, , Basic Books; Bulkeley, K., (2016) Big dreams: The science of dreaming and the origins of religion, , Oxford University Press; Cassibba, R., Granqvist, P., Costantini, A., Gatto, S., Attachment and god representations among lay Catholics, priests, and religious: A matched comparison study based on the adult attachment interview (2008) Developmental Psychology, 44 (6), p. 1753. , https://doi.org/10.1037/a0013772; Clark, A., Whatever next?

Recent experimental surveys conducted in social psychology have posited a two-factor structure of mind perception in folk psychology consisting of agency and experience. The complementarity of the roles of moral agents and patients explains the automatic tendency to complete moral situations dyadically by finding agents whenever a moral patient is identified and vice versa. According to Zande customs, a person who has experienced a negative event regards oneself as a moral patient who subsequently completes the template by finding an agent. The mutual exclusivity of the perceptions of moral agency and patiency explains why Azande believe that witchcraft cannot make people break moral rules—to lie, to steal, to commit adultery, and to break taboos. The close association of witchcraft with harm perception and morality explains why people who behave immorally are more often accused of witchcraft. The Azande perceive children and animals as incapable of witchcraft because of their limited agency. Dyadic morality further explains why all male members of a clan cannot be witches. The moral typecasting theory elucidates why witches are conceived as having enhanced agency while being less vulnerable to harm. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Azande; dyadic morality; harm perception; mind perception; witchcraft beliefs",,"Arluke, A., Kennedy, L., Kessler, R.C., Reexamining the sick-role concept: An empirical assessment (1979) Journal of Health and Social Behavior, 20 (1), pp. 30-36. , https://doi.org/10.2307/2136476; Badcock, C.R., Mentalism and mechanism: The twin modes of human cognition (2004) Evolutionary psychology, public policy and personal decisions, pp. 99-116. , Crawford C., Salmon C., (eds), Lawrence Erlbaum Inc,.

Different practitioner types and configurations are associated with specific ecological and political dynamics that indicate a cultural evolutionary development. Relations between practitioners’ selection processes and professional activities reveal three fundamental structures of religions: (1) selection and training involving alterations of consciousness used for healing, manifested in Shamans and other shamanistic healers; (2) social inheritance of leadership roles providing a hierarchical political organization of agricultural societies, manifested in Priests; and (3) attribution of a role involving inherently evil activities, and manifested in the Sorcerer/Witch. Shamans were transformed with foraging loss, agricultural intensification, warfare, and political integration into Healers and Mediums. Priests are predicted by agriculture and political integration beyond the local community, representing the emergence of a new stratum of magico-religious practice. Priests are also responsible for political and social conditions that significantly predict the presence of the Sorcerer/Witch. These findings suggest three distinctive biosocial structures of magico-religious activity related to alterations of consciousness and endogenous healing processes; hierarchically integrated social organization; and social persecution and incorporation. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Anthropology of shamanism; Comparative religion; cross-cultural studies; cultural evolution; evolution of religion; priesthoods; religion; shamanism",,"Bourguignon, E., Evascu, T., Altered states of consciousness within a general evolutionary perspective: A holocultural analysis (1977) Behavior Science Research, 12 (3), pp. 197-216. , https://doi.org/10.1177/106939717701200303; Boyer, P., Informal religious activity outside hegemonic religions: Wild traditions and their relevance to evolutionary models (2019) Religion, Brain and Behavior, Advance online publication. , https://doi.org/10.1080/2153599X.2019.1678518; Chartrand, T., Lakin, J., The antecedents and consequences of human behavioral mimicry (2013) Annual Review of Psychology, 64 (1), pp. 285-308. , https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-psych-113011-143754; De Waal, F., (1997) Bonobo the forgotten ape, , University of California Press; Donald, M., (1991) Origins of the modern mind, , Harvard University Press; Dunbar, R., (2014) Human evolution: A pelican introduction, , [Kindle iOS version].

Belief in high gods is both hypothesized to catalyze a cognitive punishment-avoidance mechanism at the level of individual minds, and a group cultural evolutionary mechanism that amplifies in-group cooperation. Recent research into non-Western contexts not only indicates a multiplicity of supernatural influences on the individual-level and group-level mechanisms but raises questions about theoretical presuppositions about how a supernatural agent is classified as a high god or as something else. Our exploratory study operationalizes the question “Does historical China have high gods?” through the assessment of semantic associations between each of several supernatural agent categories (alleged high gods, low gods, ancestors, sage kings, and emperors) and each of several social functional content categories (punishment, reward, morality, monitoring, and religion). Analyzing collocations in a corpus of 5.7 m Chinese characters, representing all of the most influential historical Chinese-language texts, our preliminary results suggest social functions of supernatural agents in historical China were widely distributed across many species of supernatural agent thereby complicating a claim that high gods constitute a special category in relation to these social functions. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","ancestors; China; cognitive science of religion; corpus linguistics; cultural evolution; Data mining; gods",,"Atkinson, Q.D., Latham, A.J., Watts, J., Are big gods a big deal in the emergence of big groups?

In this short report, I present an overview of different unpublished studies that we conducted in my lab over the past years. Across the different studies we observed consistent effects of our experimental manipulations or variables of interest on self-report measures, but less so on behavioral and neurocognitive measures. For instance, religious people said they were more prosocial but did not donate more money (Study 1 and 2); participants experienced awe but this did not affect their body and self perception (Study 6 and 7); participants had mystical-like experiences but this did not affect the perception of their peripersonal space (Study 8 and 9); and self-reported magical thinking was unrelated to superstitious behavior (Study 11). In other studies, the hypothesized effects did not bear out as expected or were even in an unexpected direction. Participants perceived more agency in threatening pictures and scenarios, but this was not related to their supernatural beliefs (Study 3–5) and a death priming manipulation reduced rather than increased participants’ religiosity (Study 10). Thus, opening the filedrawer through the publication of short reports will hopefully further increase transparency and will help other researchers to learn from our own trials and errors. © 2020 The Author(s).

I use data from an online survey to determine whether religious behavior has the same effect. The results suggest that religiosity and attendance at religious services most strongly affect engagement with the local community and through that the numbers of friends someone has, as well as the level of trust in the local community and bondedness with friends and family. However, they seem to have little direct impact on happiness or life satisfaction. Frequency of attendance at religious services (but not private prayer) is associated with a larger sympathy group and a greater sense of bonding to congregation members. I suggest that regular attendees may feel they can count on the emotional support of congregation members more readily than they can conventional friends and family because they interact with them more often. © 2020 The Author(s).

These informal religious activities or “wild traditions” consist of services provided by individual specialists, with no formal training or organization, who generally specialize in palliating or preventing misfortune. The anthropological and historical record show that (a) such traditions are present in almost all documented human societies, (b) they have important common features, and (c) they reappear despite the political dominance of doctrinal organizations. The form of religious activity that humans spontaneously create, or re-create in the face of political suppression, comprises no stable doctrine, faith, or community of believers. In light of these facts, important corrections should be made to current models of the evolutionary underpinnings of religious thought and behavior, in particular, by taking into account the great importance of political coercion and the minor role of doctrines in the spread of religious concepts and practices. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Cultural evolution; evolutionary models; religions; shamanism",,"Ames, D., Belief in ‘witches’ among the Rural Wolof of the Gambia (1959) Africa: Journal of the International African Institute, 29 (3), pp. 263-273; Århem, K., (1981) Makuna social organization: A study in descent, alliance, and the formation of corporate groups in the north-western Amazon, , Uppsala, Sweden: Academiae Upsaliensis; Barrett, J.L., Cognitive constraints on Hindu concepts of the divine (1998) Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 37, pp. 608-619; Barrett, J.L., Keil, F.C., Conceptualizing a nonnatural entity: Anthropomorphism in God concepts (1996) Cognitive Psychology, 31 (3), pp. 219-247; Barth, F., (1975) Ritual and knowledge among the Baktaman of New Guinea, , Oslo, New Haven Conn.: Universitetsforlaget, Yale University Press; Basden, G.T., (1921) Among the Ibos of Nigeria: An account of the curious & interesting habits, customs, & beliefs of a little known African people by one who has for many years lived amongst them on close & intimate terms, , Philadelphia, PA: J.

Here we shed new light on this question by examining giving in incentivized Dictator Games where no mention of religion was made, played online with anonymous strangers. Study 1 (N = 15,827) found a significant correlation between belief and giving, r =.122 (robust to demographics). Study 2 (N = 2334) included the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) to examine whether this relationship could be explained by intuitive cognitive style driving both belief and prosociality. Study 2 replicated the correlation between belief and giving, r =.106, and found CRT to be negatively correlated with both belief, r = −.229, and giving, r = −.174. Critically, the relationship between belief and giving was reduced by 34% when controlling for CRT; and also adding basic demographics rendered the relationship non-significant. Our results suggest that—at least in this task and population—believers do show greater prosociality, but more due to intuitive cognitive style than belief per se. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","cognitive style; economic games; moral psychology; prosociality; Religious belief; religious cognition; religious psychology",,"Aarnio, K., Lindeman, M., Paranormal beliefs, education, and thinking styles (2005) Personality and Individual Differences, 39 (7), pp. 1227-1236; Ahmed, A.M., Salas, O., Is the hand of God involved in human cooperation?

Behind the similarities, there are also striking differences. While Danish Christians tend to be largely nominal members, Dutch Christians are more likely to believe in God, pray and attend church regularly. Previous research has highlighted insecurity as a source of national differences in religiosity. In this comparative study, we explore whether insecurity and threat to personal control partially contribute to one or both forms of religiosity, using data from a survey experiment and secondary international survey data. Our main findings are that Danish Christians identify more with Christianity as a cultural tradition, whereas the Dutch Christians identify more with Christianity as personal experience. Christians in both countries were more likely to identify as Christians based on their personal beliefs after a control threat manipulation. This finding suggests that belief in a higher power, rather than group tradition, is the aspect of religious identity that is triggered by insecurity and lack of control. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Compensatory control; cultural religion; European Christianity; survey experiment",,"Allport, G.W., Ross, J.M., Personal religious orientation and prejudice (1967) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 5 (4), pp. 432-443; Baumeister, R.F., Leary, M.R., The need to belong: Desire for interpersonal attachments as a fundamental human motivation (1995) Psychological Bulletin, 117 (3), pp. 497-529; Davie, G., (2007) The sociology of religion, , Los Angeles: Sage, CA; Demerath, N.J., The rise of “cultural religion” in European Christianity: Learning from Poland, Northern Ireland and Sweden (2000) Social Compass, 47 (1), pp. 127-139; Ellison, C.G., George, L.K., Religious involvement, social ties, and social support in a Southeastern community (1994) Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 33 (1), pp. 46-61; Esping-Andersen, G., (1990) The three worlds of welfare capitalism, , Cambridge: Polity Press; (2014) European social survey wave 7, , http://www.europeansocialsurvey.org, Retrieved from; Friesen, J.P., Kay, A.C., Eibach, R.P., Galinsky, A.D., Seeking structure in social organization: Compensatory control and the psychological advantages of hierarchy (2014) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 106 (4), pp. 590-609; Fritsche, I., Jonas, E., Ablasser, C., Beyer, M., Kuban, J., Manger, A.-M., Schultz, M., The power of we: Evidence for group-based control (2013) Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 49 (1), pp. 19-32; Fritsche, I., Jugert, P., The consequences of economic threat for motivated social cognition and action (2017) Current Opinion in Psychology, 18, pp. 31-36; Hervieu-Léger, D., (2000) Religion as a chain of memory, , Cambridge: Polity, Press; Hogg, M.A., Subjective uncertainty reduction through self-categorization: A motivational theory of social identity processes (2000) European Review of Social Psychology, 11 (1), pp. 223-255; Hruschka, D.J., Henrich, J., Institutions, parasites and the persistence of in-group preferences (2013) PloS One, 8 (5); Immerzeel, T., van Tubergen, F., Religion as reassurance?

Indeed, spirituality—a religious orientation that fosters universalism (i.e., an ideology of egalitarianism and inclusivity; see Hirsh, Walberg, & Peterson, 2013. Spiritual liberals and religious conservatives. Social Psychological and Personality Science, 4(1), 14–20. doi:10.1177/1948550612444138)—may correlate negatively with conservatism via decreases in the preference for group-based hierarchy (i.e., social dominance orientation; SDO). We investigated this possibility in a national sample of religiously identified adults (N = 7417). As hypothesized, religious identification correlated positively with conservatism via right-wing authoritarianism (RWA), whereas spiritual identification correlated negatively with conservatism via decreases in SDO. Moreover, political identity centrality strengthened the negative association between spirituality and SDO, as well as the positive associations RWA and SDO had with conservatism (though the RWA × Political Identity Centrality interaction was only marginally significant). Political identity centrality did not, however, moderate the positive association between religiosity and RWA. Collectively, these results demonstrate that religious and spiritual identification have countervailing associations with conservatism via distinct pathways and suggest that political awareness helps to connect some—but not all—religious orientations to socio-political views. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","political sophistication; religiosity; RWA; SDO; Spirituality",,"Abramowitz, A.I., Saunders, K.L., Is polarization a myth?

Due to cultural norms, people may be motivated to respond in a socially desirable way. In addition, deliberating about beliefs may yield different responses than intuition-based responses. To develop a better understanding of the relationship between intuition and self-reported belief, we developed a new implicit measure of supernatural belief. Specifically, we adapted the Affective Misattribution Procedure (AMP) to measure supernatural belief. In a preregistered online study of 404 American participants, we found that the strength of associations between supernatural entities (e.g., god, devil, heaven) and the concept “real” (as opposed to the concept “imaginary”) predicted self-reported supernatural belief and self-reported religious behavior, and these associations were of comparable magnitude to those found in studies where supernatural belief was measured implicitly using the Implicit Association Test (IAT). These results provide provisional evidence that the AMP can be used as an implicit measure of supernatural belief. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Affect Misattribution Procedure; belief; implicit; prime; religiosity; Semantic Misattribution Procedure; supernatural",,"Atran, S., (2002) In gods we trust: The evolutionary landscape of religion, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Bachmann, R.E., Development of a German implicit measure of religiosity (2014) Archive for the Psychology of Religion, 36, pp. 214-232; Bar-Anan, Y., Nosek, B.A., Reporting intentional rating of the primes predicts priming effects in the affective misattribution procedure (2012) Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 38 (9), pp. 1194-1208; Bar-Anan, Y., Nosek, B.A., A comparative investigation of seven indirect attitude measures (2014) Behavior Research Methods, 46 (3), pp. 668-688; Bar-Anan, Y., Vianello, M., A multi-method multi-trait test of the dual-attitude perspective (2018) Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 147 (8), pp. 1264-1272; Barrett, J.L., (2004) Why would anyone believe in God?, , Walnut Creek, CA: Altamira Press; Baumard, N., Boyer, P., Religious beliefs as reflective elaborations on intuitions: A modified dual-process model (2013) Current Directions in Psychological Science, 22 (4), pp. 295-300; Bering, J., Atheism is only skin deep: Geertz and Markusson rely mistakenly on sociodemographic data as meaningful indicators of underlying cognition (2010) Religion, 40 (3), pp. 166-168; Bluemke, M., Friese, M., Reliability and validity of the Single-Target IAT (ST-IAT): Assessing automatic affect towards multiple attitude objects (2008) European Journal of Social Psychology, 38 (6), pp. 977-997; Boudry, M., Coyne, J., Disbelief in belief: On the cognitive status of supernatural beliefs (2016) Philosophical Psychology, 29 (4), pp. 601-615; Boyer, P., (2001) Religion explained: The evolutionary origins of religious thought, , New York, NY: Basic Books; Boyer, P., Why “belief” is hard work: Implications of Tanya Luhrmann’s when god talks back (2013) HAU: Journal of Ethnographic Theory, 3 (3), pp. 349-357; Brownstein, M., Madva, A., Gawronski, B., What do implicit measures measure?

Rituals that are perceived high in pain and behavioral synchrony increase social bonding, but the relative contribution of perceived pain vs. synchrony is unexplored. In addition, gender differences are rarely investigated in experimental studies of ritual, despite known gender differences in ritual participation, emotional processing, social bonding and pain processing. The current study uses data from 137 participants in a naturally occurring high ordeal ritual lasting 10 days. Because all individuals participated in multiple rituals varying in perceived pain and synchrony, it was possible to separate the unique and joint effects in a natural context. We found strong bonding effects for rituals perceived as painful, but not for synchrony. Rituals rated as higher in level of pain (involving cuts, piercings and burns) were associated with greater self-reported social bonding. Gender moderated these effects: Women reported stronger bonding after participating in non-synchronous rituals perceived higher in pain, whereas men reported greater bonding after synchronous activities with more perceived pain. These findings suggest that pain-related processes are a more potent social bonding mechanism than synchrony in naturally occurring high ordeal rituals, but that perceived pain may have different signaling functions depending on the gender of performers. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","costly signaling; cultural evolution; gender; Pain; ritual; social bonding; synchrony",,"Alabas, O.A., Tashani, O.A., Tabasam, G., Johnson, M.I., Gender role affects experimental pain responses: A systematic review with meta-analysis (2012) European Journal of Pain, 16 (9), pp. 1211-1223; Aron, A., Aron, E.N., Smollan, D., Inclusion of other in the self scale and the structure of interpersonal closeness (1992) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 63 (4), pp. 596-612; Balliet, D., Li, N.P., Macfarlan, S.J., Van Vugt, M., Sex differences in cooperation: A meta-analytic review of social dilemmas (2011) Psychological Bulletin, 137, pp. 881-909; Bartley, E.J., Fillingim, R.B., Sex differences in pain: A brief review of clinical and experimental findings (2013) British Journal of Anaesthesia, 111, pp. 52-58; Bastian, B., Jetten, J., Fasoli, F., (2011) Cleansing the soul by hurting the flesh: The guilt-reducing effect of pain, , Psychological Science, 22, 334–335; Bastian, B., Jetten, J., Ferris, L.J., Pain as social glue: Shared pain increases cooperation (2014) Psychological Science, 25, pp. 2079-2085; Bates, D., Mächler, M., Bolker, B., Walker, S., Fitting linear mixed-effects models using lme4 (2015) Journal of Statistical Software, 67 (1), pp. 1-48; Beit-Hallahmi, B., (2015) Psychological perspectives on religion and religiosity, , London: Routledge; Bell, C., (1992) Ritual theory, ritual practice, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Bliese, P., (2002) Multilevel modeling in R (2.2): A brief introduction to R, the multilevel package and the NLME package, , https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Bliese_Multilevel.pdf, Retrieved from; Bourguignon, E., Introduction: A framework for the comparative study of altered states of consciousness (1973) Religion, altered states of consciousness and social change, pp. 3-38. , Bourguignon E., (ed), Columbus: Ohio State University Press,.

However, one of the most common natural religious primes, petitionary prayer, could in theory have the opposite effect, as it implies and asserts external attributions for behavior. We tested whether petitionary prayer, despite its association with religiosity, might nevertheless increase cheating and whether such effects would differ as a function of participants’ religious beliefs. American participants (N = 251) completed an online “Swahili translation” task that afforded cheating; half were asked to compose a prayer to improve their performance. Results showed that religiosity (measured as supernatural beliefs) was associated with a greater probability of cheating, as well as more extensive cheating among those that did cheat; prayer decreased the likelihood of cheating (but not its extent) among religious people only. Mediational analyses suggested that, counterintuitively, it was believers’ beliefs about God’s control, rather than about God’s capacity for punishment, that explained the effects. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","cheating; divine attributions; Prayer; supernatural monitoring and punishment",,"Allport, G.W., Ross, J.M., Personal religious orientation and prejudice (1967) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 5 (4), pp. 432-443; Aveyard, M.E., A call to honesty: Extending religious priming of moral behavior to Middle Eastern Muslims (2014) PLOS One, 9 (7); Barrett, J.L., How ordinary cognition informs petitionary prayer (2001) Journal of Cognition and Culture, 1 (3), pp. 259-269; Baumeister, R.F., Masicampo, E.J., DeWall, C.N., Prosocial benefits of feeling free: Disbelief in free will increases aggression and reduces helpfulness (2009) Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 35 (2), pp. 260-268; Benson, H., Greenwood, M.M., Klemchuk, H., The relaxation response: Psychophysiologic aspects and clinical applications (1975) The International Journal of Psychiatry in Medicine, 6 (1-2), pp. 87-98; Bering, J.M., McLeod, K., Shackelford, T.K., Reasoning about dead agents reveals possible adaptive trends (2005) Human Nature: An Interdisciplinary Biosocial Perspective, 16 (4), pp. 360-381; Bluemke, M., Jong, J., Grevenstein, D., Miklouši, I., Halberstadt, J., Measuring cross- cultural supernatural beliefs with self-and peer-reports (2016) PLOS ONE, 11 (10); Broedling, L.A., Relationship of internal-external control to work motivation and performance in an expectancy model (1975) Journal of Applied Psychology, 60 (1), pp. 65-70; Capps, D., The psychology of petitionary prayer (1982) Theology Today, 39 (2), pp. 130-141; de Hart, J., Dekker, P., Hellemans, S., Jonkers, P., Floating believers: Dutch seekers and the church (2015) A Catholic minority Church in a world of seekers, pp. 71-96. , Hellemans S., Jonkers P., (eds), Washington, DC: The Council for Research Values and Philosophy, &,.

I outline a broad taxonomy of the choices on offer for signaling models, and examples of how previous and potential approaches to modeling religious signaling meet or fail to meet the initial promise of the theory. A pluralist approach to religious signaling seems possible, but this would require a high level of detail and specificity with respect to both formal models and target systems. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","evolution; explanation; modeling; Religion; signaling",,"Alcorta, C., Religion, social signaling, and health: A psychoneuroimmunological approach (2017) Religion, Brain & Behavior, 7 (3), pp. 243-246; Alcorta, C.S., Sosis, R., Ritual, emotion, and sacred symbols : The evolution of religion as an adaptive complex (2005) Human Nature, 16 (4), pp. 323-359; Alexander, R.D., (1987) The biology of moral systems, , Hawthorne, NY: A. de Gruyter; Axelrod, R.M., (1984) The evolution of cooperation, , New York: Basic Books; Ayasse, M., Schiestl, F.P., Paulus, H.F., Ibarra, F., Francke, W., Pollinator attraction in a sexually deceptive orchid by means of unconventional chemicals (2003) Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences, 270 (1514), pp. 517-522; Bandes, S.A., Remorse and criminal justice (2016) Emotion Review, 8 (1), pp. 14-19; Biernaskie, J.M., Perry, J.C., Grafen, A., A general model of biological signals, from cues to handicaps (2018) Evolution Letters, 2 (3), pp. 201-209; Birch, J., (2017) The philosophy of social evolution, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Bourrat, P., Origins and evolution of religion from a Darwinian point of view: Synthesis of different theories (2015) Handbook of evolutionary thinking in the sciences, pp. 761-780. , Heams T., Huneman P., Lecointre G., Silberstein M., (eds), Dordrecht: Springer Netherlands,.

It begins by giving a more nuanced account of the relationship between signals, rituals, and costs, showing that the costly signaling model of religion is best seen as a family of models. These vary in the extent to which they scale from smaller to larger social worlds. Some are scale-independent; others can be scaled up, but only by overcoming increasingly difficult signal broadcast problems; one is an intrinsically small scale intimate social world model. These issues of scalability are then integrated with transformations in the character and function of ritual and belief, as ritual becomes an instrument for competitive interactions within and across groups, and an expression of unequal status and power, while also retaining in important ways earlier roles of mediating social cohesion. Changes in ritual were both a mechanism and an expression of the shift to a less equal social world. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","costly signaling; Costly signaling model of religion; honest signaling; Neolithic transition; ritual; transegalitarian societies",,"Alcorta, C., Sosis, R., Ritual, emotion, and sacred symbols (2005) Human Nature, 16 (4), pp. 323-359; Ambrose, S., Lorenz, K., Social and ecological models for the middle stone age in Southern Africa (1990) The emergence of modern humans, pp. 3-33. , Mellars P., (ed), Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, &,.

This article considers three mechanisms by which such attitudes may be adaptive, and relates them to central theories regarding the evolution of religion. The first, “deterrence” mechanism functions to dissuade coercive expropriation of valuable resources. This mechanism explains the existence of sacred value attitudes prior to the development of religion and also explains analogues of sacred value in non-human species. The two remaining mechanisms, “assurance” and “coalitional,” are more likely to have been involved in the cultural evolution of specifically religious behavior. In the assurance mechanism, sacred value attitudes increase the cost of ideological commitments, making them more reliable as signals of a cooperative disposition. In the coalitional mechanism, sacred value attitudes make it dangerous for third parties to dissent from a social norm, and thus discourage competitor ideologies. While both these mechanisms are compatible with major accounts of the evolution of religion, different theories suggest a greater or lesser emphasis on one mechanism or the other. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","evolution; religion; Sacred value; signalling",,"Aimone, J.A., Iannaccone, L.R., Makowsky, M.D., Rubin, J., Endogenous group formation via unproductive costs (2013) The Review of Economic Studies, 80 (4), pp. 1215-1236; Atran, S., (2014) Talking to the enemy: Faith, brotherhood, and the (un)making of terrorists, , New York: HarperCollins; Atran, S., Norenzayan, A., Religion’s evolutionary landscape: Counterintuition, commitment, compassion, communion (2004) Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 27 (6), pp. 713-730; Baker, W.E., (2005) America’s crisis of values: Reality and perception, , Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press; Baron, J., Spranca, M., Protected values (1997) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 70 (1), pp. 1-16; Berns, G.S., Bell, E., Capra, C.M., Prietula, M.J., Moore, S., Anderson, B., Atran, S., The price of your soul: Neural evidence for the non-utilitarian representation of sacred values (2012) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 367 (1589), pp. 754-762. , …; Black-Michaud, J., (1975) Cohesive force: Feud in the Mediterranean and the Middle East, , Oxford: Blackwell; Boehm, C., (1984) Blood revenge: The anthropology of feuding in Montenegro and other tribal societies, , Lawrence, KA: University Press of Kansas; Boehm, C., (1999) Hierarchy in the forest: The evolution of egalitarian behavior, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Botero, C.A., Gardner, B., Kirby, K.R., Bulbulia, J., Gavin, M.C., Gray, R.D., The ecology of religious beliefs (2014) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 111 (47), pp. 16784-16789; Brosnan, S.F., de Waal, F.B.M., Monkeys reject unequal pay (2003) Nature, 425 (6955), pp. 297-299; Brosnan, S.F., Jones, O.D., Gardner, M., Lambeth, S.P., Schapiro, S.J., Evolution and the expression of biases: Situational value changes the endowment effect in chimpanzees (2012) Evolution and Human Behavior, 33 (4), pp. 378-386; Bulbulia, J., Religious costs as adaptations that signal altruistic intention (2004) Evolution and Cognition, 10 (1), pp. 19-42; Chen, A., (2015) The New Yorker, , Conversion via Twitter., November 23; Crockett, M.J., Moral outrage in the digital age (2017) Nature Human Behaviour, 1 (11), pp. 769-771; DeScioli, P., Kurzban, R., A solution to the mysteries of morality (2013) Psychological Bulletin, 139 (2), pp. 477-496; Essler, J.L., Marshall-Pescini, S., Range, F., Domestication does not explain the presence of inequity aversion in dogs (2017) Current Biology, 27 (12), pp. 1861-1865; Fiorina, M.P., Abrams, S.J., political polarization in the American public (2008) Annual Review of Political Science, 11 (1), pp. 563-588; Frank, R.H., (1988) Passions within reason: The strategic role of the emotions, , New York: W.

I argue here that most counter-empirical beliefs held by members of most religions are optional most of the time, and were optional all of the time in prehistory. Beliefs held by foragers and other individuals in situations where survival may depend on them are not very counter-empirical compared to locally available alternatives. More generally, human beings are cognitively extravagant—that is, they are capable of entertaining beliefs about a large number of things other than their immediate physical environment, but it is only in modern environments that their cognitive extravagance typically becomes costly enough to pose a problem for evolutionary explanation. In a nutshell, counter-empirical beliefs are a by-product rather than a precondition of religious membership and practice, and were unlikely to have been adaptively costly in environments that were evolutionarily relevant for human beings. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Belief; evolution; foragers; religion",,"Atran, S., Folk biology and the anthropology of science: Cognitive universals and cultural particulars (1998) Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 21, pp. 547-569; Atran, S., (2002) In gods we trust: The evolutionary landscape of religion, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Auriol, E., Lassébie, J., Panin, A., Raiber, E., Seabright, P., (2019), Religious organizations as competing platforms.

However, the extent to which such differences capture the variation of religious individuals remains unclear. Latent Profile Analysis offers a powerful statistical method for obtaining typologies from the response profiles of religious individuals. Here, we draw on a national sample of religiously-identified New Zealanders (N = 1484) and use LPA to obtain typologies for diversity in attitudes to religion as assessed by a combination of religious orientations, fundamentalism, and religious group narcissism/humility. The most parsimonious model recovers five types. To illustrate the importance of this descriptive typology, we evaluate the predictions of a church-sect theory against it. Consistent with church-sect theory, we find a greater density of intrinsic/exclusive types (Fundamentrinsics and X-trinsics) among informal/marginal religious groups and a greater density of extrinsic/inclusive types (Moderinsics and Disaffected) among established/mainstream churches. However, the data also reveal an unexpected feature: about 50% of religious affiliates across both marginal and mainstream Christian groups present as either Questrinsics or Moderinsics. Collectively, our findings illustrate how rigorous descriptive statistical models may combine with national-scale data to evaluate classical theories of religious change, while also raising new explanatory challenges for future evolutionary scholars of religions. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Church; God; LPA; New Zealand attitudes and values study; religion; schismogenesis; schisms; sect",,"Allport, G., (1954) The nature of prejudice, , Reading, MA: Addision-Wesley; Allport, G.W., Ross, J.M., Personal religious orientation and prejudice (1967) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 5 (4), pp. 432-443; Altemeyer, B., Hunsberger, B., Authoritarianism, religious fundamentalism, quest, and prejudice (1992) The International Journal for the Psychology of Religion, 2, pp. 113-133; Bainbridge, W.S., Stark, R., Client and audience cults in America (1980) Sociology of Religion, 41 (3), pp. 199-214; Batson, C.D., Daniel Batson, C., Schoenrade, P.A., Quest scale (1991) PsycTESTS Dataset; Batson, C.D., Schoenrade, P., Ventis, W.L., (1993) Religion and the individual: A social-psychological perspective, , New York: Oxford University Press; Batson, C.D., Schoenrade, P.A., Measuring religion as quest: 1) Validity concerns (1991) Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 30, pp. 416-429; Bulbulia, J., Geertz, A.W., Atkinson, Q.D., Cohen, E., Evans, N., Francois, P., Gintis, H., Wilson, D.S., The cultural evolution of religion (2013) Cultural evolution, pp. 381-404. , Richerson P.J., Christiansen M., (eds), Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, …,.

High rates of turnover in narrative content allowed them to incorporate accurate reference to short-lived resources, but was a significant obstacle to the preservation of a story over long periods. Evidence for relatively high rates of religious change challenges us to explain the mechanisms for persistent evolution of religious narrative. This paper proposes an evolutionary model consisting of three elements: (i) creation of novel narratives by recombination of a pool of themes, characters, personalities, and actions, based on the ambiguous and polysemic understanding of dreams and existing myths; (ii) selection or modification of narratives in response to group/audience reactions, leading to some being attached to rites and popularized, (iii) development of regional differences because of the place-attachment of events and characters in stories. Evolutionary change was driven by competition between individual men or alliances of men of high standing who claimed rights to new mythic and ritual domains. Aboriginal myths were therefore not fixed in time, in conservative social systems, but were rapidly changing as individuals and groups renegotiated power relationships and world views. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Aborigines; Australia; cultural evolution; myth; religion",,"Bennett, T., Making and mobilising worlds: Assembling and governing the other (2010) Material powers: Cultural studies, history and the material turn, pp. 190-208. , Bennett T., Joyce P., (eds), Sydney: Routledge,.

A review of the psychology of religion literature reveals a paradox: individuals benefit from belief in divine benevolence, while groups benefit from belief in divine punishment. We propose that a resolution to this paradox lies in the combination of cognitive systems and culturally-transmitted social norms. We suggest that, as access to reflective thinking capacity is depleted, unreflective thinking driven by culturally-transmitted decision rules that are themselves shaped by local environments (e.g., norms, schemas, and scripts) play a central role in shaping beliefs about the minds of gods. We first review the psychological literature and examine how cognition and social norms might combine to favor certain patterns of beliefs around what gods know, care about, and do. We use a cultural evolutionary lens to indicate ways that various beliefs about gods’ minds may confer adaptive benefits to individuals or groups across various socio-ecological contexts, focusing on three cultural strategies: honor, face, and dignity. Along the way, we draw from existing data to predict what shapes gods’ minds may take and suggest ways to test predictions drawn from this review. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","cultural evolution; Dual Processes; supernatural agent beliefs; Supernatural punishment",,"Abu Raiya, H., Pargament, K.I., Mahoney, A., Stein, C., A psychological measure of Islamic religiousness: Development and evidence for reliability and validity (2008) International Journal for the Psychology of Religion, 18 (4), pp. 291-315; Allport, G.W., Ross, J.M., Personal religious orientation and prejudice (1967) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 5 (4), pp. 432-443; Armstrong, K., (2006) The great transformation: The beginning of our religious traditions, , 1st ed., New York: Random House; Atkinson, Q.D., Bourrat, P., Beliefs about god, the afterlife and morality support the role of supernatural policing in human cooperation (2011) Evolution and Human Behavior, 32 (1), pp. 41-49; Bader, C.D., Desmond, S.A., Mencken, F.C., Johnson, B.R., Divine justice: The relationship between images of god and attitudes toward criminal punishment (2010) Criminal Justice Review, 35 (1), pp. 90-106; Barrett, H.C., Kurzban, R., Modularity in cognition: Framing the debate (2006) Psychological Review, 113 (3), pp. 628-647; Barrett, J.L., Exploring the natural foundations of religion (2000) Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 4 (1), pp. 29-34; Barrett, J.L., Keil, F.C., Conceptualizing a nonnatural entity: Anthropomorphism in God concepts (1996) Cognitive Psychology, 31 (3), pp. 219-247; Baumeister, R.F., Exline, J.J., Self-control, morality, and human strength (2000) Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology, 19 (1), pp. 29-42; Beck, R., Jessup, R.K., The multidimensional nature of quest motivation (2004) Journal of Psychology and Theology, 32 (4), pp. 283-294; Benet-Martinez, V., Leu, J., Lee, F., Morris, M.W., Negotiating biculturalism: Cultural frame switching in Biculturals with oppositional versus compatible cultural identities (2002) Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, 33 (5), pp. 492-516; Beugelsdijk, S., Welzel, C., Dimensions and dynamics of national culture: Synthesizing Hofstede with Inglehart (2018) Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, 49 (10), pp. 1469-1505; Boccignone, G., Cordeschi, R., Predictive brains: Forethought and the levels of explanation (2012) Frontiers in Psychology, 3, pp. 1-2; Boiger, M., Güngör, D., Karasawa, M., Mesquita, B., Defending honour, keeping face: Interpersonal affordances of anger and shame in Turkey and Japan (2014) Cognition & Emotion, pp. 1-15; Bourrat, P., Atkinson, Q.D., Dunbar, R.I.M., Supernatural punishment and individual social compliance across cultures (2011) Religion, Brain & Behavior, 1 (2), pp. 119-134; Bowles, S., Endogenous preferences: The cultural consequences of markets and other economic institutions (1998) Journal of Economic Literature, 36 (1), pp. 75-111; Boyer, P., (2001) Religion explained: The evolutionary origins of religious thought, , New York: Basic Books; Braam, A.W., Mooi, B., Schaap-Jonker, H., van Tilburg, W., Deeg, D.J.H., God image and five-factor model personality characteristics in later life: A study among inhabitants of Sassenheim in The Netherlands (2008) Mental Health, Religion & Culture, 11 (6), pp. 547-559; Bradshaw, M., Ellison, C.G., Flannelly, K.J., Prayer, God imagery, and symptoms of psychopathology (2008) Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 47 (4), pp. 644-659; Bradshaw, M., Ellison, C.G., Marcum, J.P., Attachment to God, images of God, and psychological distress in a Nationwide sample of presbyterians (2010) International Journal for the Psychology of Religion, 20 (2), pp. 130-147; Brison, K.J., Crafting sociocentric selves in religious discourse in rural Fiji (2001) Ethos (Berkeley, Calif), 29 (4), pp. 453-474; Burke, B.L., Martens, A., Faucher, E.H., Two decades of terror management theory: A meta-analysis of mortality salience research (2010) Personality and Social Psychology Review, 14 (2), pp. 155-195; Bushman, B.J., Ridge, R.D., Das, E., Key, C.W., Busath, G.L., When God sanctions killing: Effect of scriptural violence on aggression (2007) Psychological Science, 18 (3), pp. 204-207; Callen, J.L., Morel, M., Richardson, G., Do culture and religion mitigate earnings management?

I consider three. On the first interpretation, “morality” is understood as an evolved faculty for making moral judgments, where moral judgments are a special category of normative judgments. For seventy years, philosophers and psychologists have sought to characterize this special subset of normative judgments in a well-motivated way. But I maintain that these efforts have failed, and that the likely explanation is that there is no special subset of normative judgments of the sort that philosophers and psychologists have in mind. The upshot is that religion played no role in the evolution of the faculty for making moral judgments because there is no such faculty. A second interpretation of the question asks whether religion played a role in the evolution of norm psychology. I argue that the answer is probably no, because the evolution of norm psychology can be explained without appealing to religion. A third interpretation of the question asks whether religion played a role in the cultural (as opposed to biological) evolution of norms. Here, I contend, the answer is obviously yes. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","cultural evolution; Evolution of morality; method of cases; moral-conventional task; norm psychology; social learning",,"Boyd, R., (2018) A different kind of animal: How culture transformed our species, , Princeton: Princeton University Press; Boyd, R., Richerson, P., Punishment allows the evolution of co-operation (or anything else) in sizeable groups (1992) Ethology and Sociobiology, 13, pp. 171-195; Buchtel, E., Guan, Y., Peng, Q., Su, Y., Sang, B., Chen, S., Bond, M., Immorality east and west: Are prototypically immoral behaviors especially harmful, or especially uncultured?

These participants report many more such incidents than the matched, non-autistic group participants, and current research suggests that unusual somatosensory experiences are prevalent in the autistic population. Attribution of invisible agency is understood as a sense-making coping strategy, and it is argued that esoteric content in fantasy literature, movies and computer games explain why these young adults prefer to attribute agency to ghosts, spirits and demons, rather than god(s). The study thereby extends and challenges the study of autism and religiosity by exploring the intersection between autistic embodiment and encultured cognition. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

It is theorized that, given recurrent ancestral risks of predation and frequent contact with other dangerous agents, mechanisms for agency detection may have evolved and play an important role in facilitating belief in supernatural agents. Thus, agency detection and belief in supernatural agents may be correlated in modern populations. College students (N = 107) completed a survey assessing belief in various supernatural phenomena, and participated in a virtual reality (VR) task where they indicated the perceived presence of agents (agency detection). Results indicated that the VR task successfully induced false agency detection such that the majority of participants perceived the presence of an agent at least once where no agent was present. Women reported greater overall supernatural belief than men. False agency detection was not related to belief in supernatural agents, and was instead related to belief in Feng Shui. These findings were unanticipated, and inconsistent with the study’s main hypothesis. Discussion emphasizes theoretical and methodological considerations for future research on agency detection and supernatural belief. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","agency detection; evolution; evolutionary psychology; supernatural agents; supernatural belief; virtual reality",,"Aarnio, K., Lindeman, M., Paranormal beliefs, education, and thinking styles (2005) Personality and Individual Differences, 39, pp. 1227-1236; Andersen, M., Predictive coding in agency detection (2017) Religion, Brain & Behavior, , Advance online publication; Andersen, M., Pfeiffer, T., Müller, S., Schjoedt, U., Agency detection in predictive minds: A virtual reality study (2017) Religion, Brain & Behavior, , Advance online publication; Ashton, M.C., Lee, K., The HEXACO–60: A short measure of the major dimensions of personality (2009) Journal of Personality Assessment, 91, pp. 340-345; Atran, S., (2002) In gods we trust: The evolutionary landscape of religion, , New York, NY: Oxford University Press; Barnes, K., Gibson, N.J., Supernatural agency: Individual difference predictors and situational correlates (2013) International Journal for the Psychology of Religion, 23, pp. 42-62; Barrett, H.C., Adaptations to predators and prey (2005) The handbook of evolutionary psychology, pp. 200-223. , Buss D.M., (ed), Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons,.

An important consequence of the transition was the emergence of a polygynous, multiple-family social structure, which gave rise to mate guarding as a successful strategy. Further, as a result of sleeping on the ground, REM (rapid-eye-movement) phases were substantially extended. This produced novel dream experiences in Homo erectus, which is identified as the origin of proto-religious traits. The article argues that proto-religious dream experiences and related behavioral expressions gave males psychological and strategic advantages in keeping competitors away from their females. Given the strong selective pressure of male competition in polygynous mating systems, biological traits underlying proto-religion were successful in natural selection. Finally, it is suggested how subsequent evolutionary leaps in human cognition shaped religious thought and behavior and their role in sexual selection. The article is concluded by outlining how elements of the mate-guarding hypothesis could be tested and improved using empirical methods. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","dreams; ground sleep; homo erectus; mate guarding; Origins of religion; sexual selection; terrestrial life",,"Antón, S.C., Swisher, C.C., III, Early dispersals of homo from Africa (2004) Annual Review of Anthropology, 33 (1), pp. 271-296; Apostolou, M., Sexual selection under parental choice: The role of parents in the evolution of human mating (2007) Evolution and Human Behavior, 28 (6), pp. 403-409; Apostolou, M., Elements of parental choice: The evolution of parental preferences in relation to in-law selection (2007) Evolutionary Psychology, 5 (1), pp. 70-83; Apostolou, M., Sexual selection in ancestral human societies: The importance of the anthropological and historical records (2014) Evolutionary Behavioral Sciences, 8 (2), pp. 86-95; Bailey, A.A., Hurd, P.L., Finger length ratio (2D:4D) correlates with physical aggression in men but not in women (2005) Biological Psychology, 68 (3), pp. 215-222; de Beaune, S.A., Coolidge, F.L., Wynn, T.G., (2009) Cognitive archaeology and human evolution, , New York, NY: Cambridge University Press; Bellah, R.N., (2011) Religion in human evolution, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Berglund, A., Bisazza, A., Pilastro, A., Armaments and ornaments: An evolutionary explanation of traits of dual utility (1996) Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 58 (4), pp. 385-399; Bloch, R., Portents and prodigies (2005) Encyclopedia of religion, 11, pp. 7335-7338. , Jones L., Eliade M., Adams C.J., (eds), Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA,.

In this paper, I focus on mismatch cases in the domain of religion. I distinguish between two kinds of representations: prompts and default states. Prompts are representations that must be salient to agents in order for them to play their belief-appropriate roles, whereas default states play these roles automatically. The need for access characteristic of prompts is explained by their vehicles: prompts are realized in symbolic systems or even artifacts that make them inapt for automatic regulation of inference and behavior. I argue that some mismatch cases are explained by the fact that agents often report the contents of prompts when they report their beliefs, but behavior is controlled by prompts only when they are made salient to agents. I show that a number of otherwise puzzling findings in the cognitive science of religion, concerning belief intuitiveness, are illuminated by the distinction. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Belief; HADD theory; intuitiveness; MCI theory; mismatch",,"Amalric, M., Dehaene, S., Origins of the brain networks for advanced mathematics in expert mathematicians (2016) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 113, pp. 4909-4917; Astuti, R., Harris, P.L., Understanding mortality and the life of the ancestors in rural madagascar (2008) Cognitive Science: A Multidisciplinary Journal, 32, pp. 713-740; Atran, S., (2002) In gods we trust: The evolutionary landscape of religion, , New York, NY: Oxford University Press; Atran, S., Henrich, J., The evolution of religion: How cognitive by-products, adaptive learning heuristics, ritual displays, and group competition generate deep commitments to prosocial religions (2010) Biological Theory, 5, pp. 18-30; Barkow, J.H., Cosmides, L., Tooby, J., (1992) The adapted mind: Evolutionary psychology and the generation of culture, , New York, NY: Oxford University Press, &, (Eds; Barlev, M., Mermelstein, S., German, T., Core intuitions about persons coexist and interfere with acquired Christian beliefs about God (2017) Cognitive Science, 41, pp. 425-454; Barlev, M., Mermelstein, S., German, T., Representational coexistence in the God concept: Core knowledge intuitions of God as a person are not revised by Christian theology despite lifelong experience (2018) Psychonomic Bulletin & Review, , Advance online publication; Barrett, J.L., Theological correctness: Cognitive constraint and the study of religion (1999) Method & Theory in the Study of Religion, 11, pp. 325-339; Barrett, J.L., (2004) Why would anyone believe in God?, , New York, NY: AltaMira Press; Barrett, J.L., Keil, F., Conceptualizing a non-natural entity: Anthropomorphism in god concepts (1996) Cognitive Psychology, 31, pp. 219-247; Barrett, J.L., Trigg, R., Cognitive and evolutionary studies of religion (2016) The roots of religion: Exploring the cognitive science of religion, pp. 1-15. , Trigg R., Barrett J.L., (eds), London: Routledge, &,.

According to their synthesis, the process of cultural group selection driven by group competition has recruited our proclivity to adopt and spread religious beliefs and engage in religious practices to increase within group solidarity, harmony, and cooperation. While their account has much merit, I believe it only tells us half the story of how institutional religions have evolved. Their cultural evolutionary account of religion only looks at the cultural dynamics arising from competition between groups, not at the dynamics arising from within the group. Drawing from game-theoretic analyses of the emergence and cultural evolution of social institutions, I outline two sets of important “within-group” dynamics that shape institutional religions. The first follow from the necessity to keep the interaction of the participants in an equilibrium state in order to maintain the social institution. The second arise from the competition of institutional features for traction within the group. Bringing these dynamics into account enables us to explain prominent features of institutional religions that cannot be satisfactorily explained by the current model of the cultural evolution of religions. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Cognitive science of religion; cultural evolution of religion; cultural group selection; game theory; social ontology; within-group dynamics",,"Ahmed, A., Salas, O., Implicit influences of Christian religious representations on dictator and prisoner’s dilemma game decisions (2011) Journal of Socio-Economics, 40, pp. 242-246; Aimone, J., Iannaccone, L., Makowsky, M., Rubin, J., Endogenous group formation via unproductive costs (2013) Review of Economic Studies, 80 (4), pp. 1215-1236; Aoki, M., (2001) Toward a comparative institutional analysis, , Cambridge: MIT Press; Atkinson, Q., Bourrat, P., Beliefs about God, the afterlife and morality support the role of supernatural policing in human cooperation (2011) Evolution and Human Behavior, 32, pp. 41-49; Atran, S., (2002) In gods we trust, , New York, NY: Oxford University Press; Atran, S., Henrich, J., The evolution of religion: How cognitive by-products, adaptive learning heuristics, ritual displays, and group competition generate deep commitments to prosocial religion (2010) Biological Theory, 5, pp. 18-30; Azzi, C., Ehrenberg, R., Household allocation of time and church attendance (1975) Journal of Political Economy, 83 (1), pp. 27-56; Barrett, J., Exploring the natural foundations of religion (2000) Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 4, pp. 29-34; Barrett, J., (2004) Why would anyone believe in God?, , Walnut Creek, CA: AltaMira Press; Berman, E., Sect, subsidy and sacrifice: An economist’s view of ultra-orthodox Jews (2000) Quarterly Journal of Economics, 115, pp. 905-953; Binmore, K., (2005) Natural justice, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Boudry, M., De Smedt, J., In mysterious ways: On petitionary prayer and subtle forms of supernatural causation (2011) Religion, 41 (3), pp. 449-469; Boyer, P., (2001) Religion explained, , New York, NY: Basic Books; Bulbulia, J., Sosis, R., Signaling theory and the evolution of religious cooperation (2011) Religion, 41 (3), pp. 363-388; Chwe, M., (2001) Rational ritual, , Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press; Cohen, E., Mundry, R., Kirshner, S., Religion, synchrony, and cooperation.

While researchers have suggested that past CRED exposure is an important variable for predicting who does and does not become a religious believer, it is unclear how CREDs relate to when a person rejects the religious beliefs modeled to them during their upbringing. Using a large sample of formerly believing atheists, two analyses assessed the ability of CREDs to predict the age at which an individual became an atheist. In the first analysis (n = 5,153), CREDs were positively associated with a delay in Age of Atheism, with family-level religious variables (Religious Importance, Religious Choice, and Religious Conflict) moderating this relationship. In the second analysis (n = 3,210), CREDs remained a stable predictor of Age of Atheism while controlling for demographics, parental quality, religious variables, relational variables, and institutional variables. Overall, while findings support a robust relation of CREDs to atheistic outcomes even when controlling for many other variables that influence religious transmission processes, they also highlight the importance of considering how such other variables modify the impact of CREDs on (non)religious outcomes. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","atheism; cognitive science of religion; Credibility enhancing displays; parental quality; religious choice; religious conflict; religious socialization",,"Bandura, A., (1971) Social learning theory, , Morristown:, NJ: General Learning Press; Bandura, A., Commentary: On the psychosocial impact and mechanisms of spiritual modeling (2003) International Journal for the Psychology of Religion, 13 (3), pp. 167-173; Bargh, J.A., Chartrand, T.L., The unbearable automaticity of being (1999) American Psychologist, 54 (7), pp. 462-479; Barrett, J.L., Cognitive science of religion: What is it and why is it?

Here, we provide the first test of this hypothesis within a realistic combat paradigm (i.e., simulated knife fighting). We primed the presence of supernatural aid and collected measures of trait religiosity as well as political orientation, which typically covaries with religiosity and has been similarly linked with battle confidence in prior research. Consistent with predictions, participants evinced greater confidence in their own performance in an imminent knife battle following a guided visualization exercise analogous to prayer summoning supernatural aid. Moreover, individual differences in trait religiosity comparably predicted battle confidence, an effect that was not accounted for by covarying differences in political orientation, which also predicted battle confidence if analyzed independently of religiosity. Against expectations, we observed limited effects of the visualization manipulation or religiosity, and no effect of political orientation, on coalitional confidence in the groups participants fought alongside.

This has clear survival advantages. It also has consequences at the phenomenological level of integrated experience. Although both hemispheres are involved in all experience, the characteristics of right hemisphere phenomenology, in particular its greater capacity to sustain ambiguity, understand meaning that lies beyond language, and perceive systemic wholes, means that it is more likely to be able to accommodate religious thought and experience. Since critiques of religion tend to have the opposite characteristics (those of left hemisphere phenomenology), arguments about the nature and meaning of religion may depend on which hemisphere’s “version” of the world is privileged. Some consequent metaphysical, epistemological and ethical issues are explored, drawing on brain studies and a range of other disciplinary and experiential perspectives. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Crucially, we distinguish general religious beliefs (such as God exists) from personal religious beliefs that directly refer to the agent holding the belief or to her peripersonal time and space (such as God appeared to me last night). On our model, people acquire general religious beliefs mostly from their surrounding culture; however, people use agency-intuitions and other low-level experiences to form personal religious beliefs. We call our model the Interactive Religious Experience Model (IREM). IREM inverts received versions of Hyperactive Agency-Detection Device Theory (HADD Theory): instead of saying that agency-intuitions are major causes of religious belief in general, IREM says that general belief in supernatural agents causes people to seek situations that trigger agency-intuitions and other experiences, since these enable one to form personal beliefs about those agents. In addition to developing this model, we (1) present empirical and conceptual difficulties with received versions of HADD Theory, (2) explain how IREM incorporates philosophical work on indexical belief, (3) relate IREM to existing anthropological and psychological research, and (4) propose future empirical research programs based on IREM. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

What are the social consequences of this development? We test in a laboratory study in Kenya whether exposure to atheist arguments affects self-reported and implicit religiosity, subjective wellbeing, and self-reported tolerance of different social groups. We find a significant negative effect of emotional arguments against religion on both self-reported and implicit measures of religiosity, especially among men, but no effect of scientific appeals. Subjective wellbeing is strongly reduced after emotional atheist messages, again especially among men, suggesting that emotional atheist arguments may have a wellbeing cost. We find no effects of atheism messages on self-reported tolerance. Together, these results suggest that emotional atheist arguments reduce religiosity and subjective wellbeing, especially among men. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Atheism; laboratory experiment; priming; wellbeing",,"Anderson, M.L., Multiple inference and gender differences in the effects of early intervention: A reevaluation of the Abecedarian, Perry Preschool, and Early Training projects (2008) Journal of the American Statistical Association, 103 (484), pp. 1481-1495; Ano, G.G., Vasconcelles, E.B., Religious coping and psychological adjustment to stress: A meta-analysis (2005) Journal of Clinical Psychology, 61 (4), pp. 461-480; Bassett, J.F., Connelly, J.N., Terror management and reactions to undocumented immigrants: Mortality salience increases aversion to culturally dissimilar others (2011) The Journal of Social Psychology, 151 (2), pp. 117-120; Benjamin, D.J., Berger, J.O., Johannesson, M., Nosek, B.A., Wagenmakers, E.J., Berk, R., Johnson, V.E., Redefine statistical significance (2018) Nature Human Behaviour, 2 (1), pp. 6-10. , …; Bloom, P., Religion is natural (2007) Developmental Science, 10 (1), pp. 147-151; Chan, K.Q., Tong, E.M.W., Tan, Y.L., Taking a leap of faith: Reminders of God lead to greater risk taking (2014) Social Psychological and Personality Science, 5 (8), pp. 901-909; Deaton, A., Stone, A.A., Two happiness puzzles (2013) American Economic Review, 103 (3), pp. 591-597; Diener, E., Tay, L., Myers, D.G., The religion paradox: If religion makes people happy, why are so many dropping out?

Related work has focused on whether Western and non-Western adults spontaneously assign functions to natural phenomena but, to date, no studies have explored whether an assumption of intentional origins extends to a non-Western culture without an Abrahamic cultural tradition and associated design discourse. We therefore explored whether adults in China display an intentional design bias. Participants performed a speeded judgment task in which they evaluated whether depicted items were intentionally created or not. Chinese adults favored a design-based construal of natural phenomena under processing constraints. We also created a novel culturally sensitive survey to more fully document supernatural beliefs and practices. The survey confirmed participants’ primarily atheistic self-identification while also revealing various supernatural practices and animistic beliefs. Aspects of these folk beliefs positively predicted design intuitions about nature. Cumulatively, these results demonstrate that intuitions about intentional origins are present independent of any Western creationist discourse or Abrahamic God belief. They provide first evidence of a potentially universal intentional design bias in adults.

Likewise, a considerable amount of anecdotal evidence implicates its opposite, perceived “religious hypocrisy” (forthwith credibility-undermining displays or CRUDs), as a factor in the rejection of religion. However, there is currently little causal evidence on whether behaviors of either kind displayed by religious authorities directly affect pre-existing religious belief. The current study investigated this question by priming Irish self-identified “Catholic Christian” participants with either a clerical CRED or CRUD and subsequently measuring levels of explicit and implicit belief. Our results revealed no effects of immediate CRED or CRUD exposure on either implicit religious belief or three different measures of explicit religiosity. Instead, explicit (but not implicit) religiosity was predicted by past CRED exposure. Prospects and limitations of experimental approaches to CREDs and CRUDs are discussed. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Credibility-enhancing displays (CREDs); credibility-undermining displays (CRUDs); Irish Catholicism; religious hypocrisy",,"Astuti, R., Harris, P., Understanding mortality and the life of the ancestors in rural Madagascar (2008) Cognitive Science: A Multidisciplinary Journal, 32, pp. 713-740; Bader, C., Desmond, S., Do as I say and as I do: The effects of consistent parental beliefs and behaviors upon religious transmission (2006) Sociology of Religion, 67 (3), pp. 313-329; Baker, J., Smith, B., The nones: Social characteristics of the religiously unaffiliated (2009) Social Forces, 1, pp. 3-26; Bengston, V.L., Putney, N.M., Harris, S., (2013) Families and faith: How religion is passed down across generations, , New York: Oxford University Press; Boyer, P., Why “belief” is hard work: Implications of Tanya Luhrmann’s When God talks back (2013) HAU: Journal of Ethnographic Theory, 3 (3), pp. 349-357; Brown, C.G., (2012) Religion and the demographic revolution: Women and secularisation in Canada, Ireland, UK and USA since the 1960s, , Woodbridge: Boydell Press; Davidman, L., (2014) Becoming Un-orthodox: Stories of Ex-Hasidic Jews, , New York: Oxford University Press; Dennett, D., Roy, D., (2015) Scientific American, , http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-digital-transparency-became-a-force-of-nature/, How Digital Transparency Became a Force of Nature.

By using the so-called God Helmet suggestion, participants were led to believe that a placebo brain stimulation could elicit mystical experiences. In this pre-registered field study, we set out to test whether alcohol could increase participants’ susceptibility to the God Helmet suggestion in a large sample (N = 193) at a Dutch festival. Participants reported a wide range of extraordinary experiences associated with mysticism, including out-of-body experiences, involuntary movements, and the felt presence of invisible beings. Regression analyses revealed that self-identified spiritualism predicted extraordinary experiences, but neither objective nor subjective measures of alcohol intoxication increased participants’ susceptibility to the God Helmet. Methodological limitations that may explain the lack of an effect for alcohol are discussed, while we explore the usefulness of the God Helmet in the study of extraordinary experiences. © 2017, © 2017 The Author(s).

One of these contends that moralizing high gods (MHGs) were central to the development of complex societies. The key mechanism here is supernatural monitoring, which is the perception that gods observe humans and punish those who commit transgressions. The other hypothesis–the broad supernatural punishment (BSP) hypothesis–contends that it was fear of supernatural monitoring and punishment by non-MHG deities that fostered the development of socio-political complexity, and that MHGs followed rather than preceded the appearance of complex societies. To test between these hypotheses, we examined evidence for pre-Christian beliefs in Viking-Age Scandinavia (c. 750–1050 CE). We sought answers to two questions: (1) did the Vikings perceive themselves subject to supernatural monitoring and punishment? And (2) were the Norse gods MHGs? The evidence indicates that the Vikings believed themselves to be monitored by supernatural entities in some contexts, and that they could be punished for certain transgressions. However, the Norse gods do not meet all the criteria for recognition as MHGs. Taken together, these findings support the idea that socio-political complexity was fostered by non-MHG deities and not by MHGs. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","cooperation; moralizing high gods; Norse religion; prosociality; Scandinavia; socio-political complexity; supernatural monitoring and punishment; Vikings",,"Bayerschmidt, C.F., Hollander, L.M., (1998) Njals Saga, , Ware: Wordsworth Editions Ltd., &, (Trans; Byock, J., Gylfaginning (2005) The Prose Edda, pp. 9-79. , London: Penguin, (Trans; Dennis, A., Foote, P., Perkins, R., (1980) Grágás I, Laws of Early Iceland, , Winnipeg: University of Manitoba Press, &, (Trans; Ellison, R.C., Saga of the Confederates (2000) The Sagas of Icelanders, pp. 463-495. , Smiley J., Kellogg R.L., (eds), London: Penguin Books, (Trans.).

Experimental studies, however, have so far failed to lend support to some of the most common predictions that follow from current theories on agency detection. In this article, I argue that predictive coding, a highly promising new framework for understanding perception and action, may solve pending theoretical inconsistencies in agency detection research, account for the puzzling experimental findings mentioned above, and provide hypotheses for future experimental testing. Predictive coding explains how the brain, unbeknownst to consciousness, engages in sophisticated Bayesian statistics in an effort to constantly predict the hidden causes of sensory input. My fundamental argument is that most false positives in agency detection can be seen as the result of top-down interference in a Bayesian system generating high prior probabilities in the face of unreliable stimuli, and that such a system can better account for the experimental evidence than previous accounts of a dedicated agency detection system. Finally, I argue that adopting predictive coding as a theoretical framework has radical implications for the effects of culture on the detection of supernatural agency and a range of other religious and spiritual perceptual phenomena. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Agency detection; cognitive science of religion; epidemiology; HADD; perception; predictive coding; religion; supernatural agents",,"Andersen, M., Nielbo, K.L., Schjoedt, U., Pfeiffer, T., Roepstorff, A., Sørensen, J., (2017) Predictive minds in Ouija boards sessions.

Participants were instructed to detect beings in a virtual forest. Results reveal that participants expecting a high probability of encountering an agent in the forest are much more likely to make false detections than participants expecting a low probability of such encounters. Furthermore, low sensory reliability increases the false detection rate compared to high sensory reliability, but this effect is much smaller than the effect of expectations. While previous accounts of agency detection have speculated that false detections of agents may give rise to or strengthen religious beliefs, our results suggest that the reverse direction of causality may also be true. Religious teachings may first produce expectations in believers, which in turn elicit false detections of agents. These experiences may subsequently work to confirm the teachings and narratives upon which the values of a given culture are built. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Agency Detection; cognitive science of religion; HADD; perception; predictive processing; religious teachings; virtual reality",,"Andersen, M., Predictive coding in agency detection (2017) Religion, Brain & Behavior, , https://doi.org/10.1080/2153599X.2017.1387170, Advance online publication; Andersen, M., Schjoedt, U., Nielbo, K.L., Sørensen, J., Mystical experience in the lab (2014) Method and Theory in the Study of Religion, 26, pp. 217-245; Asprem, E., Explaining the esoteric imagination (2017) Aries, 17 (1), pp. 17-50; Atran, S., (2002) In gods we trust: The evolutionary landscape of religion, , New York: Oxford University Press; Barrett, J., (2004) Why would anyone believe in god?, , Walnut Creek, CA: Altamira Press; Barrett, J.L., Exploring the natural foundations of religion (2000) Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 4 (1), pp. 29-34; Barrett, J.L., Lanman, J.A., The science of religious beliefs (2008) Religion, 38 (2), pp. 109-124; Bering, J.M., McLeod, K., Shackelford, T.K., Reasoning about dead agents reveals possible adaptive trends (2005) Human Nature, 16 (4), pp. 360-381; Bloch, M., (1992) Prey into hunter: The politics of religious experience, 1987. , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Clark, A., Whatever next?

Following this logic, ambiguous threatening situations should lead people to falsely detect the presence of agents. In six threat-inducing experiments (N = 233) we have investigated whether threat induction increases agent detection. We operationalized human agent detection by means of a Biological Motion Detection Task (Experiments 1 and 2) and an Auditory Agent Detection Task (Experiment 4). Intentionality detection was operationalized by means of a Geometrical Figures Task (Experiment 3). Threat manipulations that were either weak (threatening pictures, classical horror music) or moderate (virtual reality) did not increase false human agent or intentionality detection. Moreover, participants generally had a response bias towards assuming that agents were absent (Experiments 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, and 4). Further, agent and intentionality detection measures were unrelated to individual differences in supernatural beliefs, although they were related to the negativity bias. This study reveals the boundary conditions under which the agent and intentionality detection is not intensified and provides recommendations for future research. © 2017, © 2017 The Author(s).

We examine dualist intuition development across two societies that differ in normative focus on thinking about minds. We use a new method that measures people’s tendency to interpret ambiguous stimuli using mind-body dualist thinking. We recruited 180 Canadian children (2–10 yrs) along with 42 Indigenous iTaukei Fijian children (5–13 yrs) and 38 Indigenous iTaukei Fijian adults (27–79 yrs) from a remote island community. Participants tracked a named character within ambiguous animations that could be interpreted as a mind-body switch. Animations vary “agency cues” that participants might rely on for dualistic interpretations. Results indicate early emerging dualistic inclinations across populations and reliance on “agency cues” of body proximity and appearance of eyes. “Agency cues” increase dualist interpretations from 10% to 70%, though eyes mattered more for Westernized participants. Overall, statistical models positing that dualist interpretations “emerge early and everywhere” fit our data better than models positing that dualism “develops gradually with exposure to Western cultural traditions.” Fijian participants, who normatively avoid focus on minds, offered even more dualistic interpretations when they had less Western cultural exposure (via formal education). © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","body-switching; cross-cultural; developmental; Dualism; mind-perception; psychology",,"Ahn, W.-K., Proctor, C.C., Flanagan, E.H., Mental health clinicians’ beliefs about the biological, psychological, and environmental bases of mental disorders (2009) Cognitive Science, 33 (2), pp. 147-182; Astuti, R., Harris, P., Understanding mortality and the life of the ancestors in rural Madagascar (2008) Cognitive Science: A Multidisciplinary Journal, 32 (4), pp. 713-740; Atran, S., Norenzayan, A., Religion’s evolutionary landscape: Counterintuition, commitment, compassion, communion (2004) Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 27 (6), pp. 713-770; Barrett, H.C., Bolyanatz, A., Crittenden, A.N., Fessler, D.M.T., Fitzpatrick, S., Gurven, M., Laurence, S., Small-scale societies exhibit fundamental variation in the role of intentions in moral judgment (2016) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 113 (17), pp. 4688-4693. , …; Barrett, H.C., Broesch, T., Scott, R.M., He, Z., Baillargeon, R., Wu, D., Laurence, S., Early false-belief understanding in traditional non-Western societies (2013) Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 280 (1755), p. 20122654. , https://doi.org/10.2307/23353353?ref=no-x-route:b7979c19dd7877929795e4aa940d02e0; Basow, S.A., Cross-Cultural patterns in achievement motivation - ethnic group and Sex comparisons in Fiji (1981) Presented at the annual meeting of the Eastern Psychological Association, New York; Beier, J.S., Spelke, E.S., Infants’ developing understanding of social gaze (2012) Child Development, 83 (2), pp. 486-496; Bering, J.M., Bjorklund, D.F., The natural emergence of reasoning about the afterlife as a developmental regularity (2004) Developmental Psychology, 40 (2), pp. 217-233; Bloom, P., (2004) Descartes’ baby: How the science of child development explains what makes us human, , New York: Basic Books; Bloom, P., Religion is natural (2007) Developmental Science, 10 (1), pp. 147-151; Bloom, P., Weisberg, D.S., Childhood origins of adult resistance to science (2007) Science, 316 (5827), pp. 996-997. , https://doi.org/10.2307/20036275?ref=search-gateway:bfb4ebcb131c2b7284f7901f153fa6a6; Boyer, P., (2001) Religion explained: The evolutionary origins of religious thought, , New York: Basic Books; Brison, K.J., (2007) Our wealth is loving each other: Self and society in Fiji, , Lanham, MD: Lexington Books; Callaghan, T., Moll, H., Rakoczy, H., Warneken, F., Liszkowski, U., Behne, T., Early social cognition in three cultural contexts (2011) Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development, 76 (2). , i–v– vii– 1–142; Cohen, E., Barrett, J.L., When minds migrate: Conceptualizing spirit possession (2008) Journal of Cognition and Culture, 8, pp. 23-48; Cohen, E., Burdett, E., Knight, N., Barrett, J., Cross-cultural similarities and differences in person-body reasoning: Experimental evidence from the United Kingdom and Brazilian Amazon (2011) Cognitive Science, 35, pp. 1282-1304; Cohen, E., (2007) The mind possessed: The cognition of spirit possession in an Afro-Brazilian religious tradition, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Csibra, G., Gergely, G., Bíró, S., Koós, O., Brockbank, M., Goal attribution without agency cues: The perception of “pure reason” in infancy (1999) Cognition, 72 (3), pp. 237-267; Csibra, G., Gergely, G., The teleological origins of mentalistic action explanations: A developmental hypothesis (1998) Developmental Science, 1 (2), pp. 255-259; Descartes, R., (1985) The philosophical writings of Descartes, , J.

We examined, in two multinational samples taken from pre-existing data, how national oppression–measured by an index of lack of liberty and by the number of refugees originating from the country–related to religiosity (e.g., belief in God, prayer frequency). We also examined how oppression related to authoritarianism and exclusivity, measures of conservatism often correlated with religiosity. Oppression’s relation to religiosity depended on what was controlled in the analysis: without additional controls, the relation was modestly positive; when controlling for human development and other demographic variables, the relation was modestly negative. In a separate student sample, participants at an ethnoculturally heterogeneous urban college who were primed with questions measuring religiosity were less supportive of oppression and militarization than if unprimed or primed with questions measuring authoritarianism. These findings offer preliminary evidence that religion and oppression are potentially in tension with each other. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","authoritarianism; conservatism; cross-cultural psychology; oppression; political psychology; prejudice; Religion",,"Allport, G., (1954) The nature of prejudice, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Allport, G.W., Ross, J.M., Personal religious orientation and prejudice (1967) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 5, pp. 432-443; Altemeyer, R.A., (1981) Right-wing authoritarianism, , Winnipeg, MB: University of Manitoba Press; Altemeyer, R.A., (1988) Enemies of freedom: Understanding right-wing authoritarianism, , San Francisco: Jossey-Bass; Altemeyer, R.A., (1996) The authoritarian specter, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Atran, S., Norenzayan, A., Religion’s evolutionary landscape: Counterintuition, commitment, compassion, communion (2004) Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 27, pp. 713-770; Boehm, C., (1999) Hierarchy in the forest: The evolutions of egalitarian behavior, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Boehm, C., (2012) Moral origins: The evolution of virtue, altruism and shame, , New York, NY: Basic Books; (2004), http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/wtwtgod/3475359.stm, What the world thinks of God.

For while there is much variation across religions, many or most involve supernatural agency and forces. Surely this could be such a common theme only if belief in the supernatural was in some way natural to the human mind.

First, it attempts to identify the exact problem religion poses to those developing an account of the evolution of human social life, and of the cognitive capacities that sustain that life. Having done that, the article aims to specify the criteria that an explanation of the evolution of religion should meet. Second, it presents a critique of one popular account: the idea that religion emerges as a result of cognitive biases that favor agentive thinking, that favor minimally counter-intuitive narratives, amplified and entrenched by some form of cultural evolution. Third, it sketches a positive account in which various forms of communal practice and quasi-religious activity precede the emergence of religious belief. The machinery of the cultural transmission of religion is built before religion transitions into (in part) an ideological system. I call this an ethnographic model of the evolution of religion, because the core ideas are implicit (and sometimes partly explicit) in ethnographically oriented anthropology of religion. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Evolution of religion; evolution of symbolic behavior; HADD; origins of ritual; religion and cooperation; religion and cultural evolution; religion and signals",,"Alcorta, C.S., Sosis, R., Ritual, emotion, and sacred symbols (2005) Human Nature, 16 (4), pp. 323-359; Alcorta, C.S., Sosis, R., Ritual, religion, and violence: An evolutionary perspective (2013) Oxford handbook of religion and violence, pp. 573-596. , Jerryson M., Juergensmeyer M., Kitts A.M., (eds), New York: Oxford University Press, &,.

Here, we argue that religiosity is one important factor influencing the perception and understanding of science and scientific information. In the present article, we review recent literature with the goal of answering three questions: what is the relationship between science and religion, when do science and religion conflict, and why do these conflicts exist? To answer these questions, we turn to research from the cognitive science of religion. Specifically, we argue that, while some conflicts between religion and science result from moral and epistemological contradictions, these conflicts also stem partially from cognitive mechanisms underpinning religious beliefs and scientific understanding. We review research suggesting that the same cognitive processes responsible for religious and supernatural beliefs may contribute to the rejection of science. We discuss this evidence in terms of its social and scientific implications, how it can inform our understanding of the relationship between religion and science, and how it can guide future study on this important topic. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","cognitive science of religion; Religion; review; science",,"Allum, N., Sibley, E., Sturgis, P., Stoneman, P., Religious beliefs, knowledge about science and attitudes towards medical genetics (2014) Public Understanding of Science, 23 (7), pp. 833-849; (2015), 3:2015cv00013 (Eastern District of Kentucky; Baker, J.O., Public perceptions of incompatibility between “science and religion” (2012) Public Understanding of Science, , 0963662511434908; Bamford, C., Lagattuta, K.H., A new look at children’s understanding of mind and emotion: The case of prayer (2010) Developmental Psychology, 46 (1), pp. 78-92; Barrett, J.L., (2004) Why would anyone believe in God?, , Walnut Creek, CA: AltaMira Press; Baumard, N., Boyer, P., Religious beliefs as reflective elaborations on intuitions: A modified dual-process model (2013) Current Directions in Psychological Science, 22 (4), pp. 295-300; Beit-Hallahmi, B., Atheists: A psychological profile (2007) The Cambridge companion to atheism, pp. 300-317. , Martin M., (ed), Cambridge: Cambridge University Press,.

While individual elements of such retreats have been studied, there have been no reports in the literature regarding the neurophysiological effects of these retreats. This preliminary study presents the first data we are aware of on the neurophysiological effects, particularly those related to dopamine and serotonin, in a group of participants undergoing an intensive seven-day spiritual retreat. We used DaTscan single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in 14 individuals before and closely following participation in a seven-day spiritual retreat. We observed significant decreases in dopamine transporter binding in the basal ganglia and significant decreases in serotonin transporter binding in the midbrain after the retreat program. Participating in the retreat also resulted in significant changes in a variety of psychological and spiritual measures. We also report the relationship between neurophysiological and subjective measures along with a discussion of potential methodological challenges for future studies. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","dopamine; meditation; prayer; serotonin; SPECT; spirituality; transporter",,"Acton, P.D., Kushner, S.A., Kung, M.P., Mozley, P.D., Plössl, K., Kung, H.F., Simplified reference region model for the kinetic analysis of [99mTc]TRODAT-1 binding to dopamine transporters in nonhuman primates using single-photon emission tomography (1999) European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, 26, pp. 518-526; Adams, S.A., Matthews, C.E., Ebbeling, C.B., Moore, C.G., Cunningham, J.E., Fulton, J., Hebert, J.R., The effect of social desirability and social approval on self-reports of physical activity (2005) American Journal of Epidemiology, 161 (4), pp. 389-398; Amsterdam, J.D., Newberg, A.B., Soeller, I., Shults, J., Greater striatal dopamine transporter density may be associated with major depressive episode (2012) Journal of Affective Disorders, 141, pp. 425-431; Aron, A., Fisher, H., Mashek, D.J., Strong, G., Li, H., Brown, L.L., Reward, motivation, and emotion systems associated with early-stage intense romantic love (2005) Journal of Neurophysiology, 94, pp. 327-337; Astin, J.A., Shapiro, S.L., Eisenberg, D.M., Forys, K.L., Mind-body medicine: State of the science, implications for practice (2003) Journal of the American Board of Family Practice, 16, pp. 131-147; Bartels, A., Zeki, S., The neural basis of romantic love (2000) Neuroreport, 11, pp. 3829-3834; Batson, C.D., Naifeh, S.J., Pate, S., Social desirability, religious orientation, and racial prejudice (1978) Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 17, pp. 31-41; Beck, A.T., Beck, A.W., Screening depressed patients in family practice (1972) Postgraduate Medicine, 52, pp. 81-85; Benjamini, Y., Hochberg, Y., Controlling the false discovery rate: A practical and powerful approach to multiple testing (1995) Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B, 57, pp. 289-300; Bonadonna, R., Meditation’s impact on chronic illness (2003) Holistic Nursing Practice, 17, pp. 309-319; Booij, J., Habraken, J.B., Bergmans, P., Tissingh, G., Winogrodzka, A., Wolters, E.C., van Royen, E.A., Imaging of dopamine transporters with iodine-123-FP-CIT SPECT in healthy controls and patients with Parkinson’s disease (1998) Journal of Nuclear Medicine, 39, pp. 1879-1884. , …; Booth, T.C., Nathan, M., Waldman, A.D., Quigley, A.M., Schapira, A.H., Buscombe, J., The role of functional dopamine-transporter SPECT imaging in parkinsonian syndromes, part 1 (2015) American Journal of Neuroradiology, 36, pp. 229-235; Brefczynski-Lewis, J.A., Lutz, A., Schaefer, H.S., Levinson, D.B., Davidson, R.J., Neural correlates of attentional expertise in long-term meditation practitioners (2007) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 104, pp. 11483-11488; Carlezon, W.A., Jr., Thomas, M.J., Biological substrates of reward and aversion: A nucleus accumbens activity hypothesis (2009) Neuropharmacology, 56, pp. 122-132; Cloninger, C.R., Zohar, A.H., Personality and the perception of health and happiness (2011) Journal of Affective Disorders, 128, pp. 24-32; Cropley, V.L., Fujita, M., Innis, R.B., Nathan, P.J., Molecular imaging of the dopaminergic system and its association with human cognitive function (2006) Biological Psychiatry, 59, pp. 898-907; Delgado, M.R., Reward-related responses in the human striatum (2007) Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 1104, pp. 70-88; Edwards, T.M., (2001), http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,139669,00.html, Get thee to a monastery.

To test the claim that religious symbolism has an effect on sociality, we conducted the Random Allocation Game with a symbolic prime in Pesqueiro, on the island of Marajó, Brazil, among Christians. Our prime–a Bible and a crucifix pendant–appears to have influenced the allocations made toward distant co-religionists; people who played the game in the prime condition allocated more coins to the distant co-religionist.

Here I use an experimental economic game together with ethnographic and survey data to compare religious beliefs and practices and their association with cooperative behavior across two communities–one predominantly Christian and one predominantly Kastom. Results show some evidence of bias in favor of the self in the Kastom but not the Christian village, although the overall allocations are not significantly different between villages. Allocations to self or own village were generally lower for those who professed belief in a more omniscient and rewarding supernatural agent and for those who engaged in ritual acts of devotion more frequently, although the relationship with ritual devotion and local garden spirit beliefs varied across sites. These findings highlight intriguing differences between the two sites and provide some support for the hypothesis that elements of religion may function to facilitate the expansion of cooperation to co-religionists beyond the local community. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Cultural evolution; evolution of cooperation; supernatural punishment; Vanuatu",,"Atkinson, Q.D., Latham, A.J., Watts, J., Are big gods a big deal in the emergence of big groups?

We recruit participants from traditional villages on Yasawa Island, Fiji. Yasawan religion includes belief in both universalistic Christian teachings and local deified ancestor spirits (Kalou-vu). Yasawans’ contrasting reliance on local, kin-based social networks and anonymous economic market exchange provides an interesting test case for how religious beliefs interact with wider social structures. We use an experimental priming procedure to test whether reminders of Christian vs. traditional imagery, as compared to neutral, influence local or self-favoritism in the random allocation game (RAG). We find that traditional imagery caused increased local–but not self–favoritism. Priming effects depended upon perceived resource uncertainty: participants primed with Christian imagery were most likely to allocate to distant co-religionists when they were least worried about resources. However, more uncertainty predicted higher local RAG allocations, further suggesting the importance of local social networks for managing such uncertainty. We further find additional support for previous findings that prosocial effects of punitive supernatural agent beliefs depend upon uncertainty. These findings further emphasize the interplay between contents of cultural forms like religious belief and socioecological context. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","economic games; field experiments; Fiji; religious prosociality; supernatural beliefs",,"Abramson, A., Bounding the unbounded: Ancestral land and jural relations in the interior of Eastern Fiji (2000) Land, law and environment: Mythical land, legal boundaries, pp. 191-210. , Abramson A., Theodossopoulos D., (eds), London: Pluto Press,.

As they may curb antisocial behaviors that incur costly social repercussions, supernatural punishment may help stabilize reciprocal relationships among peers. One recent elaboration of this hypothesis posits that commitment to such gods may boost prosociality to the point that it expands cooperation beyond one’s family and local community. Using three permutations of an experimental game designed to measure impartial fairness, the present study tests this hypothesis among Buddhists from the Tyva Republic. Contrary to the expanded sociality hypothesis, we found that key features of local spirits and Buddha systematically predict favoritism toward co-religionists from one’s community rather than fairness toward co-religionists from distant towns. Moreover, important indicators of class–years of formal education, material insecurity, and fluency in the Tyvan language–also predict favoritism toward local Buddhists rather than geographically distant Buddhists. We used a Buddhist protection charm as a prime condition that showed no simple effects across games, but did interact with key religious variables. Importantly, when players had a stake in the game and played against anonymous, geographically distant Buddhists, if the experiment reminded them of the Buddhist temple or charity, they were fairer toward the distant co-religionist. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Buddhism; cooperation; economic games; psychology of religion; supernatural punishment",,"Alatalu, T., Tuva—A state reawakens (1992) Soviet studies, 44 (5), pp. 881-895; Alexander, R.D., (1987) The biology of moral systems, , New Brunswick: Aldine Transaction; Atkinson, Q.D., Bourrat, P., Beliefs about god, the afterlife and morality support the role of supernatural policing in human cooperation (2011) Evolution and Human Behavior, 32 (1), pp. 41-49; Aveyard, M.E., A call to honesty: Extending religious priming of moral behavior to Middle Eastern Muslims (2014) PLoS ONE, 9 (7); Barfield, T.J., (1992) The perilous frontier: Nomadic empires and China, , Cambridge: Blackwell; Bawden, C.R., Two Mongol texts concerning obo-worship (1958) Oriens Extremus, 5 (1), pp. 23-41; Bering, J.M., McLeod, K., Shackelford, T.K., Reasoning about dead agents reveals possible adaptive trends (2005) Human Nature, 16 (4), pp. 360-381; Botero, C.A., Gardner, B., Kirby, K.R., Bulbulia, J., Gavin, M.C., Gray, R.D., The ecology of religious beliefs (2014) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 111 (47), pp. 16784-16789; Bowles, S., Gintis, H., Persistent parochialism: Trust and exclusion in ethnic networks (2004) Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization, 55 (1), pp. 1-23; Boyer, P., (1994) The naturalness of religious ideas: A cognitive theory of religion, , Berkeley: University of California Press; Bulbulia, J., Religious costs as adaptations that signal altruistic intention (2004) Evolution and Cognition, 10 (1), pp. 19-42; Bulbulia, J., Meme infection or religious niche construction?

There is likely a complex web of processes including institutions, norms, and practices that contributes to this phenomenon. Considerable evidence suggests that one such process involves certain components of religious systems that may have fostered the expansion of human cooperation in a variety of ways, including both certain forms of rituals and commitment to particular types of gods. Using an experimental economic game, our team specifically tested whether or not individually held mental models of moralistic, punishing, and knowledgeable gods curb biases in favor of the self and the local community, and increase impartiality toward geographically distant anonymous co-religionists. Our sample includes 591 participants from eight diverse societies–iTaukei (indigenous) Fijians who practice both Christianity and ancestor worship, the animist Hadza of Tanzania, Hindu Indo-Fijians, Hindu Mauritians, shamanist-Buddhist Tyvans of southern Siberia, traditional Inland and Christian Coastal Vanuatuans from Tanna, and Christian Brazilians from Pesqueiro. In this article, we present cross-cultural evidence that addresses this question and discuss the implications and limitations of our project. This volume also offers detailed, site-specific reports to provide further contextualization at the local level. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","anthropology; behavioral economics; cooperation; cross-cultural research; evolution; psychology; Religion",,"Alcorta, C.S., Sosis, R., Ritual, emotion, and sacred symbols (2005) Human Nature, 16 (4), pp. 323-359; Angrist, J.D., Pischke, J.-S., (2009) Mostly harmless econometrics: An empiricist’s companion, , Princeton: Princeton University Press; Atkinson, Q.D., Bourrat, P., Beliefs about god, the afterlife and morality support the role of supernatural policing in human cooperation (2011) Evolution and Human Behavior, 32 (1), pp. 41-49. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2010.07.008; Atkinson, Q.D., Whitehouse, H., The cultural morphospace of ritual form (2011) Evolution and Human Behavior, 32 (1), pp. 50-62; Atran, S., (2002) In gods we trust: The evolutionary landscape of religion, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Atran, S., Ginges, J., Religious and sacred imperatives in human conflict (2012) Science, 336 (6083), pp. 855-857; Atran, S., Henrich, J., The evolution of religion: How cognitive by-products, adaptive learning heuristics, ritual displays, and group competition generate deep commitments to prosocial religions (2010) Biological Theory, 5, pp. 18-30; Axelrod, R., (1984) The evolution of cooperation, , New York: Basic Books; Axelrod, R., Hamilton, W.D., The evolution of cooperation (1981) Science, 211 (4489), pp. 1390-1396; Baron-Cohen, S., (1995) Mindblindness: An essay on autism and theory of mind, , Cambridge: The MIT Press; Baron-Cohen, S., Wheelwright, S., The empathy quotient: An investigation of adults with Asperger syndrome or high functioning autism, and normal sex differences (2004) Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 34 (2), pp. 163-175; Barrett, J.L., (2004) Why would anyone believe in god?, , New York: AltaMira Press; Barrett, J.L., Keil, F.C., Conceptualizing a nonnatural entity: Anthropomorphism in god concepts (1996) Cognitive Psychology, 31 (3), pp. 219-247; Bateson, M., Nettle, D., Roberts, G., Cues of being watched enhance cooperation in a real-world setting (2006) Biology Letters, 2 (3), pp. 412-414; Baumard, N., Hyafil, A., Morris, I., Boyer, P., Increased affluence explains the emergence of ascetic wisdoms and moralizing religions (2015) Current Biology, 25 (1), pp. 10-15; Bering, J.M., McLeod, K., Shackelford, T.K., Reasoning about dead agents reveals possible adaptive trends (2005) Human Nature, 16 (4), pp. 360-381; Bliege Bird, R., Tayor, N., Codding, B.F., Bird, D.W., Niche construction and dreaming logic: Aboriginal patch mosaic burning and varanid lizards (Varanus gouldii) in Australia (2013) Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 280 (1772), p. 20132297; Boehm, C., A biocultural evolutionary exploration of supernatural sanctioning (2008) Evolution of religion: Studies, theories, and critiques, pp. 143-152. , Bulbulia J., Sosis R., Harris E., Genet R., Wyman K., (eds), Santa Margarita, CA: Collins Foundation Press,.

Two experiments were run in Fiji to test religion’s ability to expand group boundaries. Experiment 1 employed a religious prime to increase prosocial behavior towards co-religionists among Hindu Indo-Fijians in an economic game. There were no overall effects of priming, but gender-specific effects were found. Priming reduced the amount women biased coin allocations to favor their preferred group. Men showed no bias in either condition. Experiment 2 employed the same economic game, without a prime, in a sample of indigenous Fijian and Indo-Fijian Christians. In this game, the monetary allocations were made between different religious and ethnic groups to test if preferences for religious in-groups were stronger than preferences for ethnic in-groups. Indo-Fijian Christians showed bias against their own ethnic group if they were from a different religion (Hindus or Muslims), but allocated fairly towards Christians from a different ethnic group (indigenous Fijians). Indigenous Fijians allocated less money to Muslims, but not Hindus. This evidence suggests that religious bonds can overcome the preference for one’s own ethnic group and expand in-groups to multi-ethnic religious groups. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","cultural evolution; Evolution of cooperation; Indo-Fijians; parochial altruism; supernatural punishment",,"Abbink, K., Brandts, J., Herrmann, B., Orzen, H., Parochial altruism in inter-group conflicts (2012) Economics Letters, 117 (1), pp. 45-48; Ali, J., Islam and Muslims in Fiji (2004) Journal of Muslim Minority Affairs, 24 (1), pp. 141-154. , https://doi.org/http://doi.org/10.1080/1360200042000212241; Atran, S., Henrich, J., The evolution of religion: How cognitive By-products, adaptive learning heuristics, ritual displays, and group competition generate deep commitments to prosocial religions (2010) Biological Theory, 5 (1), pp. 18-30. , https://doi.org/http://doi.org/10.1162/BIOT_a_00018; Bellah, R.N., (2011) Religion in human evolution, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Bernhard, H., Fischbacher, U., Fehr, E., Parochial altruism in humans (2006) Nature, 442 (7105), pp. 912-915. , https://doi.org/http://doi.org/10.1038/nature04981; Bowles, S., Group competition, reproductive leveling, and the evolution of human altruism (2006) Science, 314 (5805), pp. 1569-1572. , https://doi.org/http://doi.org/10.1126/science.1134829; Boyer, P., Liénard, P., Why ritualized behavior?

Large-scale cooperation, however, remains a puzzle. Recent work suggests that belief in the existence of omnipresent and omnipotent moralistic deities may have contributed to the emergence and maintenance of cooperation in large-scale societies. This study examines the relationship between religiosity and cooperation in the Hadza, one of the few remaining hunter-gatherer populations in the world. Hadza were surveyed about their religious beliefs and participated in two incentivized economic games, designed to measure rule-bending in favor of one’s campmates (game 1) and self (game 2) at the expense of Hadza living in other camps. Consistent with previous ethnographic descriptions, the Hadza engage in few religious practices and lack a strong belief in the existence of powerful and moralizing deities. The Hadza also show very high levels of rule-bending. There is, however, little evidence that belief in moralistic deities is associated with decreased rule-bending within the Hadza. Instead, the findings suggest that rule-bending for one’s campmates increases as the proportion of kin in one’s camp increases. Also, Hadza living in a geographic region close to markets and increased tourism exhibit greater rule-bending in favor of self compared to more isolated Hadza. The high levels of rule-bending and low levels of religiosity observed in the Hadza are discussed in light of the strong norms of sharing and egalitarianism that characterize their lives. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","cooperation; Hadza; hunter-gatherers; prosociality; Religiosity",,"Apicella, C.L., Upper-body strength predicts hunting reputation and reproductive success in Hadza hunter–gatherers (2014) Evolution and Human Behavior, 35 (6), pp. 508-518; Apicella, C.L., Azevedo, E.M., Christakis, N.A., Fowler, J.H., Evolutionary origins of the endowment effect: Evidence from hunter-gatherers (2014) American Economic Review, 104 (6), pp. 1793-1805; Apicella, C.L., Marlowe, F.W., Fowler, J.H., Christakis, N.A., Social networks and cooperation in hunter-gatherers (2012) Nature, 481 (7382), pp. 497-501; Atran, S., Henrich, J., The evolution of religion: How cognitive by-products, adaptive learning heuristics, ritual displays, and group competition generate deep commitments to prosocial religions (2010) Biological Theory, 5 (1), pp. 18-30; Bala, G.G., (1998) Hadza stories and songs, , Los Angeles: Friends of the Hadzabe; Benjamin, D.J., Brown, S.A., Shapiro, J.M., Who is “behavioral’?

Recent evolutionary models of religious morality propose that particular types of supernatural beliefs related to moralizing and punitive high gods will have observable effects on prosociality. We tested this hypothesis, comparing the effects of diverse religious beliefs, practices, and contexts among Hindus in Mauritius. We found that specific aspects of religious belief (related to moralizing gods) as well as religious practice (participation in high-intensity rituals) were significant predictors of prosocial behavior. These findings contribute to a more nuanced understanding of religious prosociality and have significant implications for the evolution of morality. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Big Gods; experimental anthropology; Mauritius; morality; random allocation game; religion",,"Ahmed, M.A., Salas, O., Religious context and prosociality: An experimental study from Valparaíso, Chile (2013) Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 52 (3), pp. 627-637; Allen, R.B., (1999) Slaves, freedmen and indentured labourers in colonial Mauritius, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Ariely, D., (2012) The honest truth about dishonesty: How we lie to everyone–especially ourselves, , New York: HarperCollins; Aronson, E., Mills, J., The effect of severity of initiation on liking for a group (1959) The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, 59 (2), pp. 177-181; Atran, S., Henrich, J., The evolution of religion: How cognitive by-products, adaptive learning heuristics, ritual displays, and group competition generate deep commitments to prosocial religions (2010) Biological Theory: Integrating Development, Evolution, and Cognition, 5 (1), pp. 18-30; Bateson, M., Nettle, D., Roberts, G., Cues of being watched enhance cooperation in a real-world setting (2006) Biology Letters, 2, pp. 412-414; Bulbulia, J., Religious costs as adaptations that signal altruistic intention (2004) Evolution and Cognition, 10 (1), pp. 19-38; Bulbulia, J., Geertz, A.W., Atkinson, Q., Cohen, E., Evans, N., François, P., Gintis, H., Wilson, D.S., The cultural evolution of religion (2013) Cultural evolution: Society, technology, language, and religion, pp. 381-404. , Cambridge: The MIT Press, &,.

The present research builds on prior work suggesting that religious concepts help to manage the awareness of death, and expands on that work to explore the challenges of religious and atheistic terror management. It was hypothesized that religious participants would be able to sustain perceived meaning in life when reminded of death, but that atheists would be vulnerable to a reduction in meaning when reminded of death. To test that idea, Christians and atheists were first reminded of either mortality or a control topic, and then asked to rate how strongly they felt life was meaningful. Results indicated that ratings of meaning in life were lower in the mortality salience condition, relative to the control condition, among the atheists but not among the Christians.

Terror management theory provides two possible causal pathways through which religious beliefs can fulfil this function. According to the “worldview defence” account of terror management, worldviews reduce death anxiety by offering symbolic immortality: on this view, only people who accept the religious worldview in question should benefit from religious beliefs. Alternatively, religious worldviews also offer literal immortality, and may do so independently of individuals’ worldviews. Both strands of thought appear in the terror management theory literature. In this paper, we attempt to resolve this issue experimentally by manipulating religious belief and measuring explicit (Study 1) and implicit (Study 2) death anxiety. In Study 1, we found that the effect of religious belief on explicit death anxiety depends critically on participants’ own religious worldviews, such that believers and non-believers reported greater death anxiety when their worldview is threatened. In Study 2, however, we find that religious belief alleviates implicit death anxiety amongst both believers and non-believers. These findings suggest that religious beliefs can alleviate death anxiety at two different levels, by offering symbolic and literal immortality, respectively. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","death anxiety; implicit measures; Terror management theory; unconscious emotion",,"Atran, S., (2002) In gods we trust: The evolutionary landscape of religion, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Atran, S., Norenzayan, A., Religion's evolutionary landscape: Counterintuition, commitment, compassion, communion (2004) Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 27, pp. 713-730; Avarado, A.K., Templer, D.I., Bresler, C., Thomas-Dobson, S., The relationship of religious variables to death depression and death anxiety (1995) Journal of Clinical Psychology, 51, pp. 202-204; Barrett, J.L., (2004) Why would anyone believe in God?, , Walnut Creek, CA: Altamira Press; Batson, C.D., Rational processing or rationalization?

In particular, Terror Management Theory’s worldview defence hypothesis predicts that death anxiety is lowest among very religious and irreligious individuals, and highest among uncertain individuals. Likewise, the supposition that death anxiety motivates religious belief, which in turn mitigates death anxiety, predicts that religiosity increases with death anxiety among non-believers, and that death anxiety decreases as religiosity increases among believers. In both cases, a curvilinear relationship–specifically, an inverted-U curve–is predicted. We extracted 202 effect sizes from 100 studies for an “omnibus” religiosity meta-analysis, and six meta-analyses that examine particular dimensions of religiosity. We found high heterogeneity and a weak negative association between death anxiety and religiosity. A closer examination revealed that 10 of the 11 studies that directly tested for curvilinearity provided some support for an inverted-U pattern. The curvilinearity hypothesis cannot be ruled out, but more evidence–particularly on non-religious individuals, and in non-Western, non-Abrahamic contexts–is needed. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","death anxiety; fear of death; meta-analysis; religiosity; systematic review; Terror Management Theory",,"Abdel-Khalek, A.M., The structure and measurement of death obsession (1998) Personality and Individual Differences, 24, pp. 159-165; Abdel-Khalek, A.M., Death, anxiety, and depression: A comparison between Egyptian, Kuwaiti, and Lebanese undergraduates (2002) Omega, 45, pp. 277-287; Aday, R.H., Belief in afterlife and death anxiety: Correlates and comparisons (1985) Omega, 15, pp. 67-75; Allport, G.W., (1950) The individual and his religion, , New York: Macmillan; Allport, G.W., Ross, J.M., Personal religious orientation and prejudice (1967) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 5, pp. 432-443; Becker, E., (1973) The denial of death, , New York: Free Press; Burke, B.L., Martens, A., Faucher, E.H., Two decades of terror management theory: A meta–analysis of mortality salience research (2010) Personality and Social Psychology Review, 14, pp. 155-195; Card, N.A., (2011) Applied meta-analysis for social science research, , New York: Guilford Press; Carroll, M.P., Psychoanalytic theories of religion and the “Catholic problem (2010) Psychoanalysis and theism: Critical reflections on the Grünbaum thesis, pp. 81-98. , Beit-Hallahmi B., (ed), Lanham, MD: Jason Aronson,.

Research shows that people cope with the prospect of mortality with various ways to feel transcendent of death, including investing in religion and afterlife beliefs. But how would these investments be affected by the possibility of ILE through medical science? The current research provides an initial effort to answer this question by testing whether, after mortality has been made salient, portraying indefinite life extension as plausible might reduce investment in afterlife beliefs. Results showed that for participants low in religiosity, mortality salience, or an essay supporting the plausibility of ILE, decreased belief in the afterlife and increased support for ILE. Furthermore, among participants low in religiosity, the increase in support for ILE was mediated by decreased afterlife belief. These findings provide the first evidence of the psychological impact of the prospect of indefinite life extension. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","afterlife beliefs; Life extension technologies; mortality salience; religiosity",,"Allport, G.W., Ross, J.M., Personal religious orientation and prejudice (1967) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 5, pp. 432-443; Brooke, J.H., (1991) Science and religion: Some historical perspectives, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Burke, B.L., Martens, A., Faucher, E.H., Two decades of terror management theory: A meta-analysis of mortality salience research (2010) Personality and Social Psychology Review, 14, pp. 155-195; Crowne, D.P., Marlowe, D., A new scale of social desirability independent of psychopathology (1960) Journal of Consulting Psychology, 24, pp. 349-354; De Grey, A., Rae, M., (2007) Ending aging: The rejuvenation breakthroughs that could reverse aging in our lifetime, , New York: St Martin’s Press; Dechesne, M., Pyszczynski, T., Arndt, J., Ransom, S., Sheldon, K.M., van Knippenberg, A., Janssen, J., Literal and symbolic immortality: The effect of evidence of literal immortality on self-esteem striving in response to mortality salience (2003) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 84, pp. 722-737; Eagly, A.H., Chaiken, S., Attitude strength, attitude structure, and resistance to change (1995) Attitude strength: Antecedents and consequences, 4, pp. 413-432. , Petty R.E., Krosnick J.A., (eds), Hillside, NJ: Erlbaum, &,.

The causal architectures of these models are informed by empirical research on the effects of mortality salience on “religiosity” (and vice versa). They are also informed by research on the way in which perception of personal and environmental hazards activate evolved cognitive and coalitional precautionary systems that can intensify anxiety-alleviating behaviours such as imaginative engagement with supernatural agents postulated within a religious coalition. The capacity of the models to produce emergent patterns and behaviours that are similar to the results of other empirical studies supports the plausibility of their causal architectures. After tracing some of the literature that supports the causal dynamics of our models, we present the two models, describe the experiments, and report the results. We conclude by discussing the importance of the findings, the limitations of the models, and directions for future research. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","agent-based model; cognition; computer simulation; multi-agent AI; religion; religiosity; ritual; system-dynamics model; Terror management theory",,"Arrowood, R.B., Vail, K.E., Jong, J., Hood, R.W., Jr., Foreword: Special terror management theory issue Religion, Brain & Behavior, 6. , in press; Atkinson, Q.D., Whitehouse, H., The cultural morphospace of ritual form (2011) Evolution and Human Behavior, 32, pp. 50-62; Bainbridge, W.S., Neural network models of religious beliefs (1995) Sociological Perspectives, 38, pp. 483-495; Bainbridge, W.S., (2006) God from the machine: Artificial intelligence models of religious cognition, , Lanham, MD: Altamira Press; Becker, E., (1985) Escape from evil, , Reissue edn., New York: Free Press; Becker, E., (1997) The denial of death, , New York: Free Press; Boyer, P., Firat, R., Van Leeuwen, F., Safety, threat, and stress in intergroup relations (2015) Perspectives on Psychological Science, 10, pp. 434-450; Boyer, P., Liénard, P., Why ritualized behavior?

In support of this assertion, studies reveal that stimuli that heighten the awareness of death (mortality salience) increase investment in and defense of cultural worldviews (e.g., religion). Although past research has elucidated different forms of mortality salience-induced religious worldview defense, no study to date has considered how death-awareness contributes to apocalyptic beliefs derived from religious prophecy. The present research indicates that individual differences in religious fundamentalism interact with mortality salience to influence religious apocalyptic beliefs. For people higher in religious fundamentalism, mortality salience increased apocalyptic beliefs.

Across all biological taxa, organisms sacrifice quantity for quality of offspring. If all things were equal, then, religious individuals would be expected to produce lower-quality offspring and religions with high fertility levels would be expected to be lower-quality populations. Studies of modern populations demonstrate that humans sacrifice quantity for quality of offspring, yet children born to religious parents do not appear to suffer. I propose the Alloparenting Signaling Model, which asserts that religious cultures function as cooperative breeding niches that motivate alloparenting from large kin networks, as well as unrelated co-religionists, to enable high-quantity, high-quality reproductive strategies, and that shared parental care partially explains successful religions. Evaluating this model will require methods from human behavioral ecology as well as traditional ethnography. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","alloparenting; Fertility; life history theory; quantity-quality trade-offs; religious demography",,"Blake, J., (1989) Family size and achievement (Studies in Demography), , Berkeley: University of California Press; Blume, M., The reproductive benefits of religious affiliation (2009) The biological evolution of religious mind and behavior, pp. 117-126. , Eckart V., Schiefenhövel W., (eds), New York: Springer–Verlag,.

More specifically, how does the introduction of religion transform morality? The article operationalizes morality as normative and meta-ethical judgments and tries to specify ways to answer the question at three different levels: phylogenetic, historical, and ontogenetic. At the phylogenetic level, the possibility of moral judgments in non-human (and non-religious) primates is explored. At the historical level, a way to explore the question of how the rise of religions with Big Gods transformed morality is proposed. At the ontogenetic level, the effect of religious training in childhood and a shift to non-belief in adulthood on morality is explored. Finally, investigating the reverse causal influence (i.e., moral beliefs transforming religiosity) and the role of religious rituals (rather than religious beliefs) on morality are proposed as future directions. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","history; meta-ethics; normative ethics; ontogeny; phylogeny; religion",,"Hamlin, J.K., Wynn, K., Bloom, P., Social evaluation by preverbal infants (2007) Nature, 450, pp. 557-559; MacLean, E.L., Hare, B., Nunn, C.L., Addessi, E., Amici, F., Anderson, R.C., Boogert, N.J., The evolution of self-control (2014) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 111 (20), pp. E2140-E2148; Norenzayan, A., (2013) Big gods: How religion transformed cooperation and conflict, , Princeton: Princeton University Press; Estimating the reproducibility of psychological science (2015) Science, 349 (6251), p. aac4716. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.aac4716; Riedl, K., Jensen, K., Call, J., Tomasello, M., No third-party punishment in chimpanzees (2012) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 109 (37), pp. 14824-14829; Xygalatas, D., Mitkidis, P., Fischer, R., Reddish, P., Skewes, J., Geertz, A.W., Bulbulia, J., Extreme rituals promote prosociality (2013) Psychological Science, 24 (8), pp. 1602-1605; Yilmaz, O., Bahçekapili, H.G., Without God, everything is permitted?

The HPs identify and investigate the ubiquitous evolutionary, cognitive, and neural processes that undergird the disparate array of religious phenomena. Many of the proposals offer fresh perspectives on conventional components of religion by connecting the study of religion to disciplines as diverse as psychiatry, semiotics, and statistics. In these ways, the HPs demonstrate the naturalness of religion in the evolution of the human species. This short commentary briefly explores the issues of the definition of religion, religion and morality, the naturalistic basis for religious hermeneutics, and tradition-centered research and suggests ways in which the humanities can inform and enrich bio-cultural approaches. It proposes that collaboration between science and the humanities can advance research and help illuminate religion’s relevance to humanity’s lived experience. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","cognitive science; exegesis; morality; Religion",,"(2013) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, , 5th ed., Washington, DC","Green, W.S.; Departments of Religious Studies and Philosophy, United States; email: wgreen@miami.edu",,"Routledge",2153599X,,,,"English","Relig.

Predicting religious extremism could–in principle–allow us to respond to, mediate, or eliminate threats more efficiently. It is argued here that predicting religious extremism is possible but religious systems are complex dynamic systems and should be addressed as such. To address religious systems in a way that could provide useful predictions, one should use multi-agent artificial intelligence models that are validated using empirical studies of human cognition to define rules for the agents and historical and contemporary data sources (ex. “big-data” and historical databases) to calibrate and parameterize simulations. Ultimately, I conclude that near-term prediction is possible if one incorporates social and biological environments as well as inter- and intra-agent cognitive mechanisms, but long term predictions would be unreliable. Key to this approach is the admission that cognitive mechanisms play crucial roles in the generation and transmission of culture as well as the recognition that social and biological environments provide input to these mechanisms but neither social or biological environmental input is sufficient by itself. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","cognitive science; complex systems; informatics; modeling and simulation; predictive analytics; Religion",,"Arnaboldi, V., Passarella, A., Conti, M., Dunbar, R.I.M., (2015) Online social networks : human cognitive constraints in Facebook and Twitter personal graphs, , Amsterdam: Elsevier; Atran, S., Ginges, J., Religious and sacred imperatives in human conflict (2012) Science, 336 (6083), pp. 855-857; Axtell, R.L., Epstein, J.M., Dean, J.S., Gumerman, G.J., Swedlund, A.C., Harburger, J., Parker, M., Population growth and collapse in a multiagent model of the Kayenta Anasazi in Long House Valley (2006) Generative social science: Studies in agent-based computational modeling, pp. 117-129. , Epstein J.M., (ed), Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press,.

It may be that religion is an evolutionarily evoked disease-avoidance strategy. Adopting this perspective can help us better understand some of the most perplexing questions that religion poses. It can help us understand the universal nature of purity-related religious practices, the relation between religious conservatism and prejudice, sex differences in religiosity, and regional differences in religious participation.

In the spirit of Hilbert, albeit in empirical mode, we pose the following question to scholars of religion: What is the causal relationship between death anxiety and religious belief? This question we decompose into four sub-questions: Do people fear death?Does religiosity covary systematically with death anxiety?Does death anxiety cause or enhance religious belief?Does religious belief mitigate death anxiety? On the face of it, this focus on the fear of death seems parochial; it is indeed narrow in scope, but so were most of Hilbert’s mathematical problems. Besides getting at a prominent intuition among laypeople and academics alike–that people are religious because they fear death–the route to answering our question will require scholars of religion to work together across disciplines, clarify our terms, design better measures and manipulations, and conduct cross-cultural research. Thus, as Hilbert put it, we believe that “the gain which science obtains from the problem” will be great. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","death anxiety; fear of death; religion; religiosity",,"Ellis, L., Wahab, E.A., Religiosity and fear of death: A theory–oriented review of the empirical literature (2013) Review of Religious Research, 55, pp. 149-189; Jong, J., Halberstadt, J., (2016) Death, anxiety, and religious belief, , London, UK: Bloomsbury; Jong, J., Halberstadt, J., Bluemke, M., Foxhole atheism, revisited: The effects of mortality salience on explicit and implicit religious belief (2012) Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 48, pp. 983-999; Jong, J., Ross, R., Philip, T., Chang, S.H., Simons, N., Halberstadt, J., (2016) The religious correlates of death anxiety: A systematic review and meta-analysis, , In press; Kirkpatrick, D.R., Age, gender and patterns of common intense fears among adults (1984) Behaviour Research and Therapy, 22, pp. 141-150; Kübler-Ross, E., (1969) On death and dying, , New York, NY: Macmillan; Lyons, L., (2005) What frightens America’s youth?

Biologists call this mode of communication aposematic signaling, from the Greek apo “away” and sema “sign.” Despite the prevalence of aposematic signaling across a broad range of biological taxa, its scope and role in human cultural evolution remains unclear. Evidence from a large database of Pacific cultures (Pulotu: https://pulotu.econ.mpg.de/) reveals that ritualized human sacrifice co-evolved with social stratification to extend and stabilize social inequality. We hypothesize that the practice of ritual killing illustrates aposematic signaling in human cultural evolution: (1) killing honestly displayed the power of social elites to harm people; (2) ritual-mythological settings displace culpability for ritual killing from elites to the gods. Aposematic signaling makes sense of otherwise puzzling practices of ritual killing in the evolutionary transition to urban societies. Here we describe fruitful horizons for inquiry that the Blatant Aposematic Signaling model opens for historians of religion. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","aposematism; database; honest signaling; morality; prestige; social complexity; stratification",,"Alcorta, C., Sosis, R., Ritual, emotion, and sacred symbols: The evolution of religion as and adaptive complex (2005) Human Nature, 16 (4), pp. 323-359; Beard, M., North, J., Price, S., (1998) Religions of Rome, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Bellah, R.N., Religious evolution (1964) American Sociological Review, 29 (3), pp. 358-374. , JSTOR; Bellah, R.N., (2011) Religion in human evolution: From the Paleolithic to the axial age, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Brown, S.S., (1991) Late Carthaginian child sacrifice and sacrificial monuments in their Mediterranean context, 3. , Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press; Bulbulia, J., The cognitive and evolutionary psychology of religion (2004) Biology and Philosophy, 19 (5), pp. 655-686; Bulbulia, J., Charismatic signalling (2009) Journal for the Study of Religion, Nature, Culture, 3 (4), pp. 518-551; Bulbulia, J., Frean, M., The evolution of charismatic cultures (2010) Method and Theory in the Study of Religion, 22, pp. 254-271; Burkert, W., (1983) Homo Necans: The anthropology of ancient Greek sacrificial ritual and myth, , Berkeley, CA: University of California Press; Burkert, W., (1996) Creation of the sacred: Tracks of biology in early religion, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Carrasco, D., (2000) City of sacrifice: The Aztec empire and the role of violence in civilization, , Boston, MA: Beacon Press; Chamberlin, E.R., (1969) The bad popes, , New York: Barnes & Noble Publishing; Cronk, L., Evolutionary theories of morality and the manipulative use of signals (1994) Zygon, 29 (1), pp. 81-101; Davies, N., (1981) Human sacrifice–in history and today, , New York: William Morrow & Company; Dumezil, G., (1970) Archaic Roman religion, , (P.

Because of the similarity between people’s mental representations of God and their mental representations of others, people’s perceptions of God may carry over to people’s perceptions of others, especially when people have recently thought about God. Two experiments examined whether priming God images through prayer leads people who believe in a benign God to view social targets in a more favorable light. In Experiment 1 (N = 57), Dutch Christians either prayed for or thought about a person, and then judged the emotions of others in the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test. The results showed that prayer led participants to read fewer hostile emotions in others’ eyes, whereas prayer had no effect on perceiving positive emotions or non-hostile negative emotions. Experiment 2 (N = 50) extended this finding by showing that prayer only reduced social perceptions of hostility among participants with a positive God image. Thus, beliefs in a benign God may enhance interpersonal trust among believers, but only when God beliefs are cognitively accessible. These findings suggest that positive God beliefs may help to promote prosocial attitudes and cooperation within religious communities. © 2017 The Author(s).

One place where memory and religion intersect is in religious rituals, which have the potential to generate important memories. Religious rituals with high levels of arousal are expected to generate especially vivid memories. In this article, previous experimental anthropological work on memory and religious rituals will be discussed within the context of an extensive background of autobiographical and episodic memory research (including aspects like episodicity, emotionality, valence, and specificity), accompanied by recommendations for future research in the cognitive science of religion. Moreover, a novel perspective, based on the literature of narrative processing, memory reconstruction, and reflection, will be proposed. In this article, it is suggested that the experience of the ritual itself may be the goal of high-arousal religious rituals, giving rise to memories with high levels of emotionality. The subsequent narrative processing of these memories, in which interpretation rather than accuracy is pivotal, allows the memories to become an important part of the participants’ life narratives, thus contributing to the participants’ identities and sense of coherence and purpose. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","arousal; Autobiographical memory; emotion; episodic memory; religion; ritual",,"Abelson, R.P., Aronson, E., McGuire, W.J., Newcomb, T.M., Rosenberg, M.J., Tannenbaum, P.H., (1968) Theories of cognitive consistency: A sourcebook, , Chicago: Rand McNally; Alcorta, C.S., Religious ritual and modes of knowing: Commentary on the cognitive resource depletion model of ritual (2013) Religion, Brain & Behavior, 3 (1), pp. 55-58; Barnier, A., (2015), 7 things about memory.

Genetic inheritance mechanisms have been studied for over a century but mechanisms of inheritance for human cultural evolution are far less well understood. Sacred religious texts have the properties required for an inheritance system. They are replicated across generations with high fidelity and are transcribed into action every generation by the invocation and interpretation of selected passages. In this article we borrow concepts and methods from genetics and epigenetics to study the “expressed phenotypes” of six Christian churches that differ along a conservative–progressive axis. Their phenotypic differences, despite drawing upon the same sacred text, can be explained in part by differential expression of the sacred text. Since the invocation and interpretation of sacred texts are often well preserved, our methods allow the expressed phenotypes of religious groups to be studied at any time and place in history. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","cultural evolution; epigenetics; Evolution; genetics; inheritance mechanisms",,"Ashe, A., Whitelaw, E., Another role for RNA: A messenger across generations (2007) Trends in Genetics, 23 (1), pp. 8-10; Atran, S., Henrich, J., The evolution of religion: How cognitive by-products, adaptive learning heuristics, ritual displays, and group competition generate deep commitments to prosocial religions (2010) Biological Theory, 5 (1), pp. 18-30; Baker, W.P., Lawson, A.E., Complex instructional analogies and theoretical concept acquisition in college genetics (2001) Science Education, 85, pp. 665-683; Bellah, R.N., (2011) Religion in human evolution: From the paleolithic to the axial age, , Cambridge, MA: Belknap Press; Blackmore, S., (1999) The meme machine, , Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press; Bulbulia, J., Sosis, R., Signalling theory and the evolution of religious cooperation (2011) Religion, 41 (3), pp. 363-388; Carneiro, R.L., (2003) Evolutionism in cultural anthropology: A critical history, , Cambridge, MA: Westview Press; Cox, M., Villamayor-Tomas, S., Hartberg, Y., The role of religion in community-based natural resource management (2014) World Development, 54, pp. 46-55; Dawkins, R., (1982) The extended phenotype, , Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press; Dawkins, R., (2006) The god delusion, , Boston: Houghton Mifflin; Dawkins, R., (2006) The selfish gene, , (30th Anniversary Edition ed.), Oxford: Oxford University Press; Day, T., Bonduriansky, R., A unified approach to the evolutionary consequences of genetic and nongenetic inheritance (2011) The American Naturalist, 178 (2), pp. E18-E36; Deacon, T.W., Memes as signs: The trouble with memes (and what to do about it) (1999) The Semiotic Review of Books, 10 (3), pp. 1-3; Edgington, E., Onghena, P., (2007) Randomizationtests, , Fourth ed., Boca Raton, FL: Chapman and Hall/CRC; Haidt, J., (2012) The righteous mind: Why good people are divided by politics and religion, , New York: Pantheon; Harris, S., (2004) The end of faith: Religion, terror, and the future of reason, , New York: W.W.

Some researchers have suggested that religion may boost self-control, and thus well-being, by requiring effortful rituals. This article proposes that costly signaling theory provides a vital explanatory tool for understanding these relationships. Signaling theories posit that religious adherents signal their commitment to religious collectives through difficult or anhedonic activities and rituals, creating a cost barrier for entry which protects religious communities against free riders. Because costly signaling behaviors require the inhibition of prepotent responses and intentional exposure to aversive stimuli, committed adherents build self-control over time. Subjective well-being is thus modeled as a longitudinal product of subjective investment in a religious social collective and the self-regulation abilities that emerge from signaling that investment. This emphasis on a feedback cycle driven by social signaling represents a novel contribution to investigations of religion and well-being. New longitudinal research in social investment theory and self-control lends the model conceptual credibility. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Costly signaling; religion and mental health; religion and self-control; ritual; self-control; social signaling; strength model; subjective well-being",,"Alcorta, C.S., Religion, health, and the social signaling model of religion (2011) Religion, Brain & Behavior, 1 (3), pp. 213-216; Alcorta, C.S., Sosis, R., Ritual, emotion, and sacred symbols: The evolution of religion as an adaptive complex (2005) Human Nature, 16, pp. 323-359; Alessandri, G., Vecchione, M., Donnellan, B.M., Eisenberg, N., Caprara, G.V., Cieciuch, J., On the cross-cultural replicability of the resilient, undercontrolled, and overcontrolled personality types (2014) Journal of Personality, 82 (4), pp. 340-353; Ali, M.R., Amir, T., Effects of fasting on visual flicker fusion (1989) Perceptual and Motor Skills, 69 (2), pp. 627-631; Anderson, C., Kraus, M.W., Galinsky, A.D., Keltner, D., The local-ladder effect social status and subjective well-being (2012) Psychological Science, 23 (7), pp. 764-771; Arévalo, S., Prado, G., Amaro, H., Spirituality, sense of coherence, and coping responses in women receiving treatment for alcohol and drug addiction (2008) Evaluation and Program Planning, 31 (1), pp. 113-123; Assari, S., Race and ethnicity, religion involvement, church-based social support and subjective health in United States: A case of moderated mediation (2013) International Journal of Preventive Medicine, 4 (2), pp. 208-217; Atkinson, Q.D., Bourrat, P., Beliefs about God, the afterlife and morality support the role of supernatural policing in human cooperation (2011) Evolution and Human Behavior, 32 (1), pp. 41-49; Atran, S., Henrich, J., The evolution of religion: How cognitive by-products, adaptive learning heuristics, ritual displays, and group competition generate deep commitments to Prosocial religion (2010) Biological Theory, 5, pp. 18-30; Atran, S., Norenzayan, A., Religion’s evolutionary landscape: Counterintuition, commitment, compassion, communion (2004) The Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 27 (6), pp. 713-730. , discussion 730–770; Aveyard, M.E., A call to honesty: extending religious priming of moral behavior to middle eastern muslims (2014) PLoS ONE, 9 (7), pp. e99447, 1-e, 7; Baetz, M., Griffin, R., Bowen, R., Koenig, H.G., Marcoux, E., The association between spiritual and religious involvement and depressive symptoms in a Canadian population (2004) The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease, 192 (12), pp. 818-822; Bahammam, A.S., Nashwan, S., Hammad, O., Sharif, M.M., Pandi-Perumal, S.R., Objective assessment of drowsiness and reaction time during intermittent Ramadan fasting in young men: A case-crossover study (2013) Behavioral and Brain Functions : BBF, 9 (1), pp. 1-9; Balbuena, L., Baetz, M., Bowen, R., Religious attendance, spirituality, and major depression in Canada: A 14-year follow-up study (2013) Canadian Journal of Psychiatry.

Results from a dual-task test in Experiment 1 indicated that allowing participants to pray about an issue in their lives improved subsequent task performance, but only for individuals who score highly on a measure of religiosity. Experiment 2 suggested that praying about a problem can bias attention in a word-search task. Similar effects were not observed for control activities. Thus, at least for people most likely to engage in religious behavior, praying about a problem appeared to liberate cognitive resources that are presumably otherwise consumed by worry and rumination, leaving individuals better able to process other information, and additionally to bias attention to favor detection of problem-relevant information. These effects suggest one cognitive process (attention) that may underlie how people come to perceive answers to prayers. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","attention; attention bias; Prayer; resource allocation",,"Bar-Haim, Y., Lamy, D., Pergamin, L., Bakermans-Kranenburg, M.J., van Ijzendoorn, M.H., Threat-related attentional bias in anxious and nonanxious individuals: A meta-analytic study (2007) Psychological Bulletin, 133, pp. 1-24; Baron, R.M., Kenny, D.A., The moderator–mediator variable distinction in social psychological research: Conceptual, strategic and statistical considerations (1986) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 51, pp. 1173-1182; Baumeister, R.F., Vohs, K.D., Tice, D.M., The strength model of self-control (2007) Current Directions in Psychological Science, 16, pp. 351-355; Calkins, M.W., The nature of prayer (1911) Harvard Theological Review, 4, pp. 489-500; Carter, E.C., McCullough, M.E., Publication bias and the limited strength model of self-control: Has the evidence for ego depletion been overestimated?

Does a cultural group’s familiarity with religious-type representations affect individuals’ memory for counterintuitive representations? Boyer’s theory asserts that concepts violating developmentally natural intuitive knowledge structures are more transmittable than other concepts. Counterintuitive representations are prevalent across cultures in religious materials, folktales, and children’s stories. A large age-representative sample in the UK and China was used to investigate the interaction of template- and schema-level effects for transmission biases endemic to cultural groups. The measure of free recall employed a mixing of presentation media for stimuli. Results were analyzed using a hierarchical linear model, with familiarity, counterintuitiveness, and delay as two-level fixed factors, and age and schema-level effects as covariates. Younger persons recalled significantly more counterintuitive stimuli than stimuli consistent with domain-specific intuitive assumptions–a trend reversed for older persons. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","concepts; counterintuitiveness; Culture; familiarity; MCI; memory; MLM; recall; religion; transmission",,"Alcorta, C.S., Religion and the life course: Is adolescence an “experience expectant” period for religious transmission?

In this article we develop a more comprehensive approach to studying cultural diversity that emulates the study of biological diversity. We compare our cultural ecosystem approach with the axis approach, using the distinction between “tight” and “loose” cultures as an example. We show that while the axis approach is useful, the cultural ecosystem approach adds considerable value to the axis approach.

Grounding the study of experience in event cognition allows us to reframe several classic problems in the study of “religious experience”: (1) the function of culture-specific knowledge in the production of experiences; (2) the relationship between original experiences and later narratives; and (3) the role of appraisal processes in experience. At the same time, construing experiences as events allows us to integrate disparate lines of research in the cognitive science of religion (CSR) in a unified framework for studying both existing and emergent phenomena. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","(religious) experiences; appraisals; building block approach; complex cultural concept (CCC); Event cognition; predictive coding",,"Agnati, L.F., Guidolin, D., Battistin, L., Pagnoni, G., Fuxe, K., The neurobiology of imagination: Possible role of interaction-dominant dynamics and default mode network (2013) Frontiers in Psychology, 4 (296); Andersen, M., Schjoedt, U., Nielbo, K.L., Sørensen, J., Mystical experience in the lab (2014) Method and Theory in the Study of Religion, 26, pp. 217-245; Anscombe, G.E.M., (1959) Intention, , Oxford: Blackwell; Asprem, E., How Schrödinger’s cat became a zombie: The epidemiology of science-based representations in popular and religious contexts Method and Theory in the Study of Religion, , in press, 28; Asprem, E., Reverse-engineering esotericism: How to prepare a complex cultural concept for the cognitive science of religion (2015) Religion; Atran, S., (2002) In gods we trust: The evolutionary landscape of religion, , New York: Oxford University Press; Bar, M., Predictions: A universal principle in the operation of the human brain (2009) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 364 (1521), pp. 1181-1182; Barrett, H.C., Kurzban, R., Modularity in cognition: Framing the debate (2006) Psychological Review, 113 (3), pp. 628-647; Barrett, J.L., (2004) Why would anyone believe in god?, , Lanham, MD: AltaMira Press; Barrett, J.L., Coding and quantifying counterintuitiveness in religious concepts: Theoretical and methodological reflections (2008) Method and Theory in the Study of Religion, 20, pp. 308-338; Barrett, J.L., Cognitive science of religion: Looking back, looking forward (2011) Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 50 (2), pp. 229-239; Barrett, J.L., Burdett, E., Porter, T.J., Counterintuitiveness in folktales: Finding the cognitive optimum (2009) The Journal of Cognition and Culture, 9, pp. 271-287; Beaney, M., (2015), “Analysis.” Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Spring 2015 edition; Boyer, P., (1994) The naturalness of religious ideas: A cognitive theory of religion, , Berkeley: University of California Press; Boyer, P., (2001) Religion explained: The evolutionary origins of religious thought, , New York: Basic Books; Boyer, P., Bergstrom, B., Evolutionary perspectives on religion (2008) Annual Review of Anthropology, 37, pp. 111-130; Boyer, P., Liénard, P., Why ritualized behavior?

Here we manipulate both factors and demonstrate their unique influence on ritual cognition. In a 2 × 3 (action type x goal information) between subjects design 484 US adults viewed causally opaque (ritual) or causally transparent (ordinary) actions performed on identical objects. They were provided with no goal information, positive goal information (“Blessing”) or negative goal information (“Cursing”). Neither causal opacity nor goal information influenced perceptions of physical change/causation. In contrast, causal opacity increased attributions of “specialness,” whereas goal information did not. Finally, goal information interacted with action type on measures of preference, such that ordinary actions are influenced by both “blessings” and “curses,” but ritual actions are only influenced by “curses.” These findings are interpreted in light of the Ritual Stance, and the cognitive bases of the effects are described with reference to Boyer and Liénard's hazard-precaution theory of ritualized behavior. The combined value of these two theories is discussed, and extended to a causal model of developmental ritual “calibration.” © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Action perception; action precaution system; causal opacity; goal demotion; religion; ritual; ritual cognition",,"Atran, S., Henrich, J., The evolution of religion how cognitive by-products, adaptive learning heuristics, ritual displays, and group competition generate deep commitments to prosocial religions (2010) Biological Theory, 5 (1), pp. 18-30; Boyer, P., Liénard, P., Why ritualized behavior?

However, because samples have previously been heavily drawn from Western cultures, it is unclear whether this is a universal cognitive bias or whether prior findings are a product of Western philosophical and theological traditions. We evaluated these possibilities by administering a speeded judgment task to adults in China–a country that underwent nearly 40 years of institutionally enforced atheism in the Maoist era and which has markedly different cultural beliefs than those found in Western societies. Results indicated that Chinese adults, like Western adults, have a propensity to favor scientifically unwarranted teleological explanations under processing constraints. However, results also yielded suggestive evidence that Chinese culture may attenuate baseline tendencies to be teleological. Overall, this study provides the strongest evidence to date of the cross-cultural robustness of a teleological explanatory bias. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","China; cognitive universals; culture; dual processing; teleology",,"Adler, J.A., Chinese religion: An overview (2005) Encyclopedia of religion, pp. 1580-1613. , Jones L., (ed), 2nd ed., Detroit, MI: Macmillan Reference; Anderson, D.L., Fisher, K.M., Norman, G.J., Development and evaluation of the conceptual inventory of natural selection (2002) Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 39, pp. 952-978; Aristotle, (2008) Physics, , (R.

A related but distinct aim is to explain why some individuals hold supernatural agent beliefs but others do not. Here, we aim to provide an initial test of the power of exposure to what Henrich calls “credibility-enhancing displays” (or “CREDs”) in determining whether or not an individual holds explicit supernatural agent beliefs. We present evidence from two studies of Americans suggesting that exposure to CREDs, as measured by a scale we developed and validated, predicts current theism vs. non-theism, certainty of God's existence/non-existence, and religiosity while controlling for overall religious socialization. These results are among the first to empirically support the theorized significance of CREDs for the acquisition of supernatural agent beliefs. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Atheism; cognitive science of religion; credibility-enhancing displays; non-theism; religious emphasis; religious socialization; theism",,"Albrecht, S.L., Cornwall, M., Cunningham, P.H., Religious leave-taking: Disengagement and disaffiliation among Mormons (1988) Falling from the faith: The causes and consequences of religious apostasy, pp. 62-80. , Bromley D., (ed), London: Sage; Allport, G.W., Ross, J.M., Personal religious orientation and prejudice (1967) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 5 (4), pp. 432-443; Atran, S., (2002) In gods we trust: The evolutionary landscape of religion, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Bader, C.D., Desmond, S.A., Do as I say and as I do: The effects of consistent parental beliefs and behaviors upon religious transmission (2006) Sociology of Religion, 67 (3), pp. 313-329; Baker, J.O.B., Smith, B., None too simple: Examining issues of religious nonbelief and nonbelonging in the United States (2009) Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 48 (4), pp. 719-733; Baker-Sperry, L., Passing on the faith: The father's role in religious transmission (2001) Sociological Focus, 34 (2), pp. 185-198; Bandura, A., (1971) Social learning theory, , New York: General Learning Press; Bandura, A., (1986) Social foundations of thought and action, , Englewood Cliffs: Pearson; Barrett, J., (2004) Why would anyone believe in god?, , Walnut Creek: Alta Mira Press; Beit-Hallahmi, B., Atheists: A psychological profile (2007) The Cambridge companion to atheism, pp. 300-317. , Martin M., (ed), Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Beit-Hallahmi, B., (2015) Psychological perspectives on religion and religiosity, , Hove: Routledge; Bengtson, V.L., Putney, N.M., Harris, S., (2013) Families and faith: How religion is passed down across generations, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Bering, J., (2010) The God instinct: The psychology of souls, destiny and the meaning of life, , London: Nicholas Brealey Pub; Bering, J.M., The folk psychology of souls (2006) Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 29 (5), pp. 453-462; Bloom, P., (2004) Descartes’ baby: How the science of child development explains what makes us human, , Cambridge, MA: Basic Books; Boyer, P., (2001) Religion explained: The evolutionary origins of religious thought, , New York: Basic Books; Buhrmester, M., Kwang, T., Gosling, S.D., Amazon's Mechanical Turk: A new source of inexpensive, yet high-quality, data?

First, it tests the extent to which (1) Schjoedt’s et al. “cognitive depletion” model (Schjoedt et al., 2013) and (2) McNamara’s “decentering” model (McNamara, 2009) can explain, biologically and psychologically, why epistemic and existential loss is often said to precede and attend illumination in the via negativa – or negative way. While McNamara’s theory proves more convincing than Schjoedt’s et al. for shedding light on cognitive underpinnings of the negative way, neither theory is fully satisfactory because neither adequately accounts for the constitutive role of social and emotional dynamics at each step in the Christian apophatic journey. The final section introduces a cognitively informed account of the apophatic path consisting of four moments: Resonance, Rupture, Reappraisal, and Repair. This account is supported largely by a turn to neurocognitive, developmental, and clinical psychological research on relationality and emotion regulation. © 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","apophaticism; cognitive science; emotion; mysticism; neuroscience; psychology; relationality; spirituality",,"Alcorta, C.S., Religious ritual and modes of knowing: Commentary on the cognitive resource depletion model of ritual (2013) Religion, Brain & Behavior, 3 (1), pp. 55-58; Amihai, I., Kozhevnikov, M., Arousal vs. relaxation: A comparison of the neurophysiological and cognitive correlates of Vajrayana and Theravada meditative practices (2014) PLoS ONE, 9 (7), pp. 1-16; Armstrong, K., (2009) The case for god., , New York, NY: Anchor Books; Atran, S., (2002) In gods we trust, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Bartels, A., Zeki, S., The neural correlates of maternal and romantic love (2004) NeuroImage, 21, pp. 1155-1166; Berkovich-Ohana, A., Dor-Ziderman, Y., Glicksohn, J., Goldstein, A., Alterations in the sense of time, space, and body in the mindfulness-trained brain: A neurophenomenologically-guided MEG study (2013) Frontiers in Psychology, 4, pp. 1-19; Boesel, C., Keller, C., (2010) Apophatic bodies: Negative theology, incarnation, and relationality., , New York, NY: Fordham University Press; Botvinick, M.M., Braver, T.S., Barch, D.M., Carter, C.S., Cohen, J.D., Conflict monitoring and cognitive control (2001) Psychological Review, 108, pp. 624-652; Botvinick, M.M., Cohen, J.D., Carter, C.S., Conflict monitoring and anterior cingulate cortex: An update (2004) Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 8, pp. 539-546; Brown, S., Religious ritual and the loss of self (2013) Religion, Brain & Behavior, 3 (1), pp. 58-60; Burkert, W., (1998) Creation of the sacred, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Butler, P.M., Religious cognition and the brain (2012) Science and the world’s religions, volume 2: Persons and groups, pp. 21-59. , McNamara P., Wildman W.J., (eds), Santa Barbara, CA: Praeger; Cakmak, Y.O., Ekinci, G., Afsar, N., Cavdar, S., Structural cortical plasticity induced by the mindfullness meditation of the Sufi whirling derwishes (2011) Neuroscience Research, Abstracts of the 34th Annual Meeting of the Japan Neuroscience Society, 71, p. e96; Caputo, J.D., (2013) The insistence of god: A theology of perhaps, , Bloomington and Indianapolis: Indiana University Press; Carrazana, E., Cheng, J., St Theresa’s dart and a case of religious ecstatic epilepsy (2011) Cognitive and Behavioral Neurology, 24, pp. 152-155; Craig, A.D., How do you feel – Now?

White claimed that scriptural dogmas of human domination have too easily justified environmental exploitation. White’s critics responded that the Bible commends ecological stewardship, which potentially restrains otherwise ruinous human tendencies to exploit. Previous studies empirically assessing these apparently conflicting claims show mixed results. We propose that the effects of religious fundamentalism and attention to scripture must be distinguished. A key novelty of our paper is the use of reported frequency of scriptural reading to measure the salience of scripture in an individual’s life. White’s hypothesis predicts that reading scripture will be associated with (1) increased fundamentalism, and (2) lower pro-environmental intentions. In contrast, the counterarguments of White’s critics predict that (3) higher frequency of scripture reading will be associated with higher pro-environmental intentions. We tested these predictions with a Bayesian Structural Equation Model that estimated the direct and indirect (mediated) effects of scripture reading on pro-environmental intentions. Our data were obtained from a cross-sectional sample of self-identified Christian participants (N = 1012) in the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study. Supporting White, we found clear evidence for a positive link between frequency of scripture reading and religious fundamentalism, and between religious fundamentalism and lower pro-environmental intentions. However, in line with White’s critics, we also found evidence for a positive direct effect of reading scripture on pro-environmental intentions. Although the positive (direct) and negative (indirect) effects of scripture reading were similar in magnitude, the negative effect, which is mediated by religious fundamentalism, appears to be slightly more probable. Collectively, our findings indicate that attention to scripture might be associated with moral ambivalence about pro-environmental intentions. © 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Christianity; environmentalism; fundamentalism; moral ambivalence; religion; scripture",,"Altemeyer, B., Hunsberger, B., Authoritarianism, religious fundamentalism, quest, and prejudice (1992) International Journal for the Psychology of Religion, 2, pp. 113-133; Atkinson, J., Salmond, C., Crampton, P., (2014) NZDep2013 Index of deprivation, , Wellington: Department of Public Health, University of Otago Wellington; Bering, J.M., Parker, B.D., Children’s attributions of intentions to an invisible agent (2006) Developmental Psychology, 42, pp. 253-262; Bulbulia, J., Spreading order: Religion, cooperative niche construction, and risky coordination problems (2012) Biology & Philosophy, 27 (1), pp. 1-27; Crampton, P., Salmond, C., Woodward, A., Reid, P., Socioeconomic deprivation and ethnicity are both important for anti-tobacco health promotion (2000) Health Education & Behavior, 27, pp. 317-327; Eckberg, D.L., Blocker, T.J., Varieties of religious involvement and environmental concerns: Testing the Lynn White thesis (1989) Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 28, pp. 509-517; Feenstra, E.S., Christian impact on ecology (1967) Science (New York, NY), 156, p. 737; Greeley, A., Religion and attitudes toward the environment (1993) Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 32 (1), pp. 19-28; Ethnicity, socioeconomic deprivation and consultation rates in New Zealand general practice (2006) Journal of Health Services Research and Policy, 11 (3), pp. 141-149; Hitzhusen, G.E., Religion and environmental education: Building on common ground (2006) Canadian Journal of Environmental Education, 11 (1), pp. 9-25; Holland, L., Scott Carter, J., Words v. deeds: A comparison of religious belief and environmental action (2005) Sociological Spectrum, 25, pp. 739-753; Hungerford, H.R., Volk, T.L., Changing learner behavior through environmental education (1990) The Journal of Environmental Education, 21 (3), pp. 8-21; Liu, J.H., Sibley, C.G., Hope for the future?

These are some of the questions that recent theoretical models and empirical studies have tried to answer by focusing on ritualized behavior instead of ritual. Ritualized behavior (i.e., a set of behavioral features embedded in rituals) increases attention to detail and induces cognitive resource depletion, which together support distinct modes of action categorization. While ritualized behaviors are perceptually similar across a range of behavioral domains, symbolically mediated experience-dependent information (so-called cultural priors) modulate perception such that communal ceremonies appear coherent and culturally meaningful, while compulsive behaviors remain incoherent and, in some cases, pathological. In this study, we extend a qualitative model of human action perception and understanding to include ritualized behavior. Based on previous experimental and computational studies, the model was simulated using instrumental and ritualized representations of realistic motor patterns and the simulation data were subjected to linear and non-linear analysis. The results are used to exemplify how action perception of ritualized behavior (a) might influence allocation of attentional resources and (b) can be modulated by cultural priors. Further explorations of the model show why behavioral experiments might fail to capture modulation effects of cultural priors and that cultural priors in general reduce the chaoticity of time-dependent action processing. © 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Action understanding; expectation modulation; ritualized behavior; rituals; simulation",,"Abbott, L.F., Lapicque's Introduction of the Integrate-and-fire Model Neuron (1907) (1999) Brain Research Bulletin, 50 (5), pp. 303-304; Aisa, B., Mingus, B., O'Reilly, R., The emergent neural modeling system (2008) Neural Networks, 21 (8), pp. 1146-1152; Alcorta, C.S., Sosis, R., Ritual, emotion, and sacred symbols (2005) Human Nature, 16 (4), pp. 323-359; Bloch, M., (1989) Ritual, history and power: Selected papers in anthropology, , Oxford: Berg Publishers; Botvinick, M.M., Plaut, D.C., Doing without schema hierarchies: A recurrent connectionist approach to normal and impaired routine sequential action (2004) Psychological Review, 111, pp. 395-429; Boyer, P., Liénard, P., Why ritualized behavior?

Here, we propose that, above a certain group-size threshold, maintaining a belief in the continued existence of authority figures after their death preserves group coordination efficiency. That is, we argue that coordination activities in larger groups become more effective when they center on symbolic (although formerly real) bearers of authority; for smaller groups, we claim the opposite occurs. Our argument is pursued by way of a collective action model that makes anthropologically plausible assumptions about human sociality. One key finding is the existence of a group-size threshold that marks the difference between the two different collective action regimes, one with and one without the presence of a deified historical figure. Another is that, in larger groups, priest-like castes naturally emerge as a consequence of the benefits of personally identifying with the deified agent. © 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","agent-based model; Ancestor worship; behavioral synchrony; deification; group coordination; priesthood",,"Atran, S., (2002) In gods we trust: The evolutionary landscape of religion, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Baines, J., Origins of Egyptian kingship, pp. 95-156. , O'Connor D., Silverman D., (eds), Ancient Egyptian kingship, Leiden: Brill; Carney, J., The Pangs of the Ulstermen: An Exchangist Perspective (2008) Journal of Indo-European Studies, 36 (1-2), pp. 52-66; Cauvin, J., (1999), The birth of gods and the origins of agriculture.

MCI theory typically posits that religious concepts violate what we call deep inferences, intuitions stemming from our evolved cognitive architecture rather than shallow inferences that are specific and flexible informational units also used for inference-making.

However, different religious motivations have differential effects on a variety of health-related outcomes, which may explain the adverse effects of religiousness found in some studies. The current study hypothesized that higher identification as religious motivation would be linked to higher health-promoting behavior and lower health-risk behavior through higher self-regulation, whereas higher introjection would be linked to lower health-promoting behavior and higher health-risk behavior through lower self-regulation. The sample included 220 adolescents (mean age = 15 years, 55% male) and their primary caregivers. Structural equation modeling results supported the hypotheses and indicated that adolescent self-regulation mediated the relations between their religious motivation and health behavior. The findings suggest that different types of religious motivation may promote or hinder adolescents' health. © 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","adolescence; health-promoting behavior; health-risk behavior; motivation; religiousness; self-regulation",,"Alcorta, C., Religious behavior and the adolescent brain (2009) The biology of religious behavior, pp. 106-122. , J.

This paper attempts to explain these trends by cross-culturally replicating experiments originally conducted in the US with participants from mixed-religious affiliations to Jains in South India. In a series of imaginative perspective-taking tasks, Jain adults reasoned about the likelihood of different people to be the reincarnation of a deceased person based on similar features between the two. Participants endorsed a concept of reincarnation as entailing a bodily change from death to rebirth. Nevertheless, in the tasks, they reasoned as though physical marks and episodic memories were superior cues to identifying reincarnated people as compared to other similarities, including other physical and mnemonic features. These decisions were heightened when the distinctiveness of the features was increased and thus the probability of another living person sharing that feature decreased. Together, these studies replicate and extend findings with US adults to suggest that such reasoning is not simply the product of cultural input and suggest a role for mundane processes of person recognition in the recurrence of reincarnation concepts and associated practices cross-culturally. © 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","cross-cultural; Jainism; personal identity; reincarnation; social cognition",,"Addis, R.D., Tippett, L.J., Memory of myself: Autobiographical memory and identity in Alzheimer's disease (2004) Memory, 12 (1), pp. 56-74; Andersen, S.M., Cole, S.W., Do I know you?” The role of significant others in general social perception (1990) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 59, pp. 384-399; Andersen, S.M., Glassman, N.S., Chen, S., Transference in social perception: The role of chronic accessibility in significant-other representations (1995) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 59, pp. 384-399; Astuti, R., Harris, P.L., Understanding mortality and the life of the ancestors in rural Madagascar (2008) Cognitive Science, 32, pp. 713-740; Barrett, J.L., Cognitive constraints on Hindu concepts of the divine (1998) Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 37, pp. 608-619; Barrett, J.L., Theological correctness: Cognitive constraint and the study of religion (1999) Method and Theory in the Study of Religion, 37, pp. 608-619; Barrett, J.L., Exploring the natural foundations of religion (2000) Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 4 (1), pp. 29-34; Barrett, J.L., Keil, F.C., Conceptualizing a nonnatural entity: Anthropomorphism in god concepts (1996) Cognitive Psychology, 31, pp. 219-247; Bastian, M., Irregular visitors: Narratives about Ogbanje (spirit children) in Southern Nigerian popular writing (2002) Readings in African popular fiction, pp. 59-66. , Newell S., (ed), Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press; Bell, C., (1931) The religion of Tibet, , London: The Clarendon Press; Bering, J.M., Intuitive conceptions of dead agent's minds: The natural foundations of afterlife beliefs as phenomenological boundary (2002) Journal of Cognition and Culture, 2, pp. 263-308; Bering, J.M., Bjorklund, D.F., The natural emergence of reasoning about the afterlife as a developmental regularity (2004) Developmental Psychology, 40, pp. 217-233; Blok, S., Newman, G., Rips, L.J., Individuals and their concepts (2005) Categorization inside and outside the lab, , Ahn W.-K., Goldstone R.L., Love B.C., Markman A.B., Wolff P., (eds), Washington, DC: American Psychological Association; Bloom, P., (2004) Descartes' baby: How child development explains what makes us human, , London: William Heinemann; Bose, A., Singh, V.K., Adhikary, M., (1991) Demographic diversity of India: 1991 census state and district level data: A reference book, , Delhi: B.R.

Historical evidence bearing on this fundamental question is scarce and inconclusive. Relevant empirical and experimental studies have often shown an association between religious variables and the promotion of collaborative attitudes, and sometimes a causal link from religion to cooperation. This study evaluates the quality of the evidence gathered to date. After reviewing previously published theoretical, empirical non-experimental, experimental, experimental-priming, meta-analytic, and hybrid studies, I identify difficulties with current research methodologies, including the lack of standard procedures. I conclude by drawing such conclusions as the existing literature permits regarding the link between religion and prosociality, arguing that religion needs to be understood not as needing to produce prosociality to appear, survive, and develop; but as emerging, surviving, and developing in a complex partnership with moral attitudes and behaviors. © 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","altruism; evolution of religion; priming; religion prosocial",,"Alcorta, C.S., Sosis, R., Ritual, emotion, and sacred symbols: The evolution of religion as an adaptive complex (2005) Human Nature, 16, pp. 323-359; Atran, S., Ginges, J., Religious and sacred imperatives in human conflicts (2012) Science, 336, pp. 855-857; Aydemgr, M., Eğġlmez, Ö., (2010) The relationship between the religiosity and the ethical attitudes of managers: An empirical study, , June, 2nd International Symposium on Sustainable Development, Sarajevo:; Batson, C.D., Sociobiology and the role of religion in promoting prosocial behavior: An alternative view (1983) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 45, pp. 1380-1385; Blagg, R.D., (2012) Exploring religiousness, community, & altruism: Implications for health., , ProQuest, UMI Dissertation, Claremont Graduate University; Blogowska, J., Saroglou, V., Religious fundamentalism and limited prosociality as a function of the target (2011) Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 50 (1), pp. 44-60; Blogowska, J., Saroglou, V., For better or worse: Fundamentalists' attitudes toward outgroups as a function of exposure to authoritative religious texts (2013) International Journal for the Psychology of Religion, 23 (2), pp. 103-125; Bloom, P., Religion, morality, evolution (2012) Annual Review of Psychology, 63, pp. 179-199; Bourrat, P., Atkinson, Q.D., Dunbar, R.I.M., Supernatural punishment and individual social compliance across cultures (2011) Religion, Brain & Behavior, 1 (2), pp. 119-134; Brown, G.R., Richerson, P.J., Applying evolutionary theory to human behaviour: Past differences and current debates (2014) Journal of Bioeconomy, 16 (2), pp. 105-128; Bulbulia, J., Sosis, R., Signalling theory and the evolution of religious cooperation (2011) Religion, 41, pp. 363-388; Doyen, S., Klein, O., Pichon, C.-L., Cleeremans, A., Behavioral priming: It's all in the mind, but whose mind?

This is done by modifying Ross Hammond and Robert Axelrod's well-known simulation, which shows that ethnocentric behavior is the most successful strategy in a spatialized game of cooperation where color is the only attribute that agents can act on. Their simulation is altered in two steps. First, the simulation is changed so that each agent can “recruit” neighboring agents to its own color with a low probability R through out-group altruism toward non-cooperative out-group members. If recruitment is successful, there is also a probability M that the converted agent “morally reforms,” that is, changes cooperation style to the cooperative agent's style. The result is that the strategy of altruism can successfully compete with ethnocentric strategies if it leads to recruitment around 1–2% of the time, and a change of cooperation style to altruism around 0.4–0.5% of the time. Second, the simulation is altered so that only agents of one color, green, can recruit the other colors through altruism. The most obvious result of this simulation is that agents of this group become increasingly dominant with an increasing probability of recruitment. More interesting is that the overall proportion of altruists decreases and ethnocentrism becomes more dominant as a cooperation strategy compared to the first modified simulation, although not as dominant as in the original simulation by Hammond and Axelrod. That is, green can dominate the board through recruitment of other colors even though only some of the green agents are “proselytizing” altruists. The simulations have bearing on (1) how altruistic behavior spreads through cultural transmission in a population and (2) the historical problem of why apparently self-destructive behaviors of generosity and non-self-defense toward out-group individuals seems to have contributed to the expansion of religious movements in certain historical periods. © 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","altruism; cognitive contagion; ethnocentrism; proselytism; religion; social influence",,"Algoe, S.B., Haidt, J., Witnessing excellence in action: The “other-praising” emotions of elevation, gratitude, and admiration (2009) Journal of Positive Psychology, 4 (2), pp. 105-127; Axelrod, R., (1984) The evolution of cooperation., , New York, NY: Basic Books; Axelrod, R., An evolutionary approach to norms (1986) American Political Science Review, 80, pp. 1095-1111; Barclay, P., The evolution of charitable behaviour and the power of reputation (2012) Applied evolutionary psychology, pp. 149-172. , Roberts S.C., (ed), Oxford: Oxford University Press; Bartlett, M.Y., DeSteno, D., Gratitude and prosocial behavior: Helping when it costs you (2006) Psychological Science, 17, pp. 319-325; Blackmore, S., (1999) The meme machine, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Boyd, R., Richerson, P., Punishment allows the evolution of cooperation (or anything else) in sizable groups (1992) Ethology and Sociobiology, 13, pp. 171-195; Boyd, R., Richerson,, P.J., Why culture is common but cultural evolution is rare (1996) Proceedings of the British Academy, 88, pp. 73-93; Burnham, T., Johnson, D.D.P., The biological and evolutionary logic of human cooperation (2005) Analyse & Kritik, 27, pp. 113-135; Chudek, M., Heller, S., Birch, S., Henrich, J., Prestige-biased cultural learning: Bystander's differential attention to potential models influences children's learning (2011) Evolution and Human Behavior, 33 (1), pp. 46-56; Cialdini, R., (2007) Influence: The psychology of persuasion, , Revised ed, New York, NY: Collins; Czachesz, I., Theologische Innovation und Sozialstruktur im Urchristentum: Eine kognitive Analyse seiner Ausbreitungsdynamik [Theological innovation and social structure in early Christianity: A cognitive analysis of its dynamics of dispersion] (2011) Evangelische Theologie, 71, pp. 259-272; Czachesz, I., Women charity and mobility in early Christianity: Weak links and the historical transformation of religions (2012) Changing minds: Religion and cognition through the ages, pp. 129-154. , Czachesz I., Biró T., (eds), Leuven: Peeters; Dawkins, R., (1976) The selfish gene, , New York, NY: Oxford University Press; Fowler, J., Christakis, N., Cooperative behavior cascades in human social networks (2010) .

Unfortunately, these mechanisms constitute second-order public goods that are vulnerable to freeriding. Religion has been proposed to solve this problem by shifting these burdens to the realm of the supernatural. However, very little research has been done to examine the specific content of beliefs in supernatural monitoring and sanctions within real world cooperative contexts. To help fill this void and to better understand the role these institutions may have played in the development of prosociality, we performed a meta-analysis of case studies (N = 48) in which religion played some role in community-based resource management (CBRM). Our findings suggest that beliefs in supernatural enforcement are common features of CBRM and that these duties are ascribed to entities ranging from ancestral spirits to gods. The specific sanctions believed to be imposed for violating rules are varied, but most often represent common occurrences that are readily open to interpretation as indications of supernatural efficacy. We propose that the provincial quality of the supernatural entities associated with CBRM may limit the scale at which they can promote prosociality and we discuss the implications this may have for the evolution of high gods. © 2014 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","community-based resource management; cooperation; evolution; prosociality; supernatural monitoring; supernatural sanctioning",,"Agrawal, A., Sustainable governance of common-pool resources: Context, methods, and politics (2003) Annual Review of Anthropology, 32, pp. 243-262; Appell, G.N., Sather, C., Wadley, R.L., Sacred places, sacred sites, and memorial groves (2001) The Encyclopaedia of Iban studies: Iban history, society, and culture, pp. 1629-1634. , Appell G.N., Sather C., Wadley R., (eds), Sarawak: Kuching; Atkinson, Q.D., Bourrat, P., Beliefs about god, the afterlife and morality support the role of supernatural policing in human cooperation (2011) Evolution and Human Behavior, 32 (1), pp. 41-49; Atran, S., Norenzayan, A., Religion’s evolutionary landscape: Counterintuition, commitment, compassion, communion (2004) Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 27, pp. 713-770; Bateson, M., Nettle, D., Roberts, G., Cues of being watched enhance cooperation in a real-world setting (2006) Biology Letters, 2, pp. 412-414; Bering, J.M., McLeod, K., Shackelford, T.K., Reasoning about dead agents reveals possible adaptive trends (2005) Human Nature, 16, pp. 360-381; Bloom, P., Religion is natural (2007) Developmental Science, 10 (1), pp. 147-151; Boyd, R., Gintis, H., Bowles, S., Richerson, P.J., The evolution of altruistic punishment (2003) PNAS Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 100, pp. 3531-3535; Byers, B.A., Cunliffe, R.N., Hudak, A.T., Linking the conservation of culture and nature: A case study of sacred forests in Zimbabwe (2001) Human Ecology, 29, pp. 187-218; Cox, M., Balancing accuracy and meaning in common-pool resource theory (2008) Ecology and Society, 13 (2), p. 44; Cox, M., Arnold, G., Villamayor-Tomás, S., A review of design principles for community-based natural resource management (2010) Ecology and Society, 15 (4), p. 38; Cox, M., Villamayor-Tomas, S., Hartberg, Y., The role of religion in community-based natural resource management (2014) World Development, 54, pp. 46-55; Dunbar, R.I.M., Coevolution of neocortex size, group size and language in humans (1993) Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 16, pp. 681-735; Dunbar, R.I.M., Gossip in evolutionary perspective (2004) Review of General Psychology, 8 (2), pp. 100-110; Fowler, C.T., The ecological implications of ancestral religion and reciprocal exchange in a sacred forest in Karendi (Sumba, Indonesia) (2003) Worldviews, 7, pp. 303-329; Geist, H.J., Lambin, E.F., Proximate causes and underlying driving forces of tropical deforestation (2002) BioScience, 52 (2), pp. 143-150; Gould, S.J., Vrba, E.S., Exaptation-a missing term in the science of form (1982) Paleobiology, 8 (1), pp. 4-15; Haley, K.J., Fessler, D.M.T., Nobody’s watching?

The received view of this theory suggests two distinct cognitive processes: one is intuitive and the other reflective. But the defining features of these two types have been called into question by recent critiques. In response, new constraints have refined the distinctive features of each type, and distinguished between distinct types of processes and differing modes of the same type. This reformulation of dual-process theory bears upon the cognitive science of religion by reorganizing our understanding of religious cognition in relation to these two types of processes. Religious belief has been traditionally associated with type 1, intuitive, processes. This paper reviews the theoretical and empirical literature on dual-process theory and religion in order to suggest that while these basic intuitive processes may support religious beliefs, we must also expand our view to understand belief in relation to varying cognitive modes. These modes exist on a continuum, and are properly understood as type 2, reflective, processes. Thus they present a more nuanced and complex framework for understanding the relationship between varying types of religious belief and cognitive styles. © 2014 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","analytical thought; cognitive styles; dual-process; intuitive thought; religious cognition",,"Aarnio, K., Lindeman, M., Paranormal beliefs, education, and thinking styles (2005) Personality and Individual Differences, 39, pp. 1227-1236; Aarnio, K., Lindeman, M., Religious people and paranormal believers: Alike or different?

We report five experiments that investigate whether processing concepts about supernatural agents facilitates agency detection. Participants were presented with point-light stimuli representing unscrambled or scrambled biological motion, or with pictures of unscrambled or scrambled faces, embedded in a noise mask. Participants were required to indicate for each stimulus whether it represented a human agent or not. Each trial was preceded by a supernatural agent prime, a human agent prime, or an animal prime. Our results showed that primes referring to humans facilitated the detection of agency. More importantly, however, results did not reveal a general effect of supernatural priming on agency detection. In three experiments, a moderating effect of religiosity was observed: supernatural agent primes had a differential effect for religious compared to non-religious participants on agency detection biases and the speed of responding to agent-like stimuli. These findings qualify the relation between supernatural beliefs and agency detection and suggest that when supernatural agent concepts have been acquired through cultural learning, these concepts can modulate agency-detection biases. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","agency detection; biological motion detection task; face/house categorization task; religion; semantic priming; supernatural beliefs",,"Atran, S., Norenzayan, A., Religion's evolutionary landscape: Counterintuition, commitment, compassion, communion (2004) Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 27, pp. 730-770. , discussion; Barnes, K., Gibson, N.J.S., Supernatural agency: Individual difference predictors and situational correlates (2013) International Journal for the Psychology of Religion, 23 (1), pp. 42-62; Barrett, J.L., Cognitive constraints on Hindu concepts of the divine (1998) Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 37, pp. 608-619; Barrett, J.L., Exploring the natural foundations of religion (2000) Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 4 (1), pp. 29-34; Barrett, J.L., Cognitive science of religion: Looking back, looking forward (2011) Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 50, pp. 229-239; Barrett, J.L., Burdett, E.R., The cognitive science of religion (2011) Psychologist, 24, pp. 252-255; Barrett, J.L., Keil, F.C., Conceptualizing a nonnatural entity: Anthropomorphism in god concepts (1996) Cognitive Psychology, 31, pp. 219-247; Barrett, J.L., Lanman, J.A., The science of religious beliefs (2008) Religion, 38 (2), pp. 109-124; Bering, J.M., The folk psychology of souls (2006) Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 29 (5), pp. 462-498. , discussion; Blakemore, S.J., Decety, J., From the perception of action to the understanding of intention (2001) Nature Reviews Neuroscience, 2, pp. 561-567; Bogacz, R., Wagenmakers, E.-J., Forstmann, B.U., Nieuwenhuis, S., The neural basis of the speed–accuracy tradeoff (2010) Trends in Neurosciences, 33 (1), pp. 10-16; Boyd, R., Richerson, P.J., An evolutionary model of social learning: The effects of spatial and temporal variation (1988) Social learning: Psychological and biological perspectives, pp. 29-48. , Zentall T.R., Galef B.G., (eds), Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates; Boyer, P., Religious thought and behaviour as by-products of brain function (2003) Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 7 (3), pp. 119-124; Boyer, P., Lienard, P., Why ritualized behavior?

Also, while perceived material insecurity has been associated with increasing religious belief, the relationships between insecurity, supernatural punishment beliefs, and prosocial behavior are unclear. In this study, we explore how material insecurity moderates the supernatural punishment beliefs that promote different expectations about distant, anonymous strangers among a sample of villagers living in Yasawa, Fiji. We examined this relationship by employing an economic game designed to measure local recipient favoritism vs. egalitarian, rule-following behavior. Using indices of three different “punishing” agents – the Christian God (“Bible God”), the deified ancestors (Kalou-vu), and the police – we find that increased belief in Bible God punishment predicts less local recipient favoritism at low and moderate but not high material insecurity. Punishing Kalou-vu also predicts less favoritism at low and moderate insecurity, but more favoritism at high insecurity. Police punishment poorly predicts favoritism, suggesting that secular authority has less impact on isolated communities. We discuss implications for understanding how different kinds of supernatural and secular agent beliefs impact prosocial behavior. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","economic games; favoritism; Fiji; gods' minds; insecurity; supernatural punishment",,"Ahmed, A.M., (2008) Are religious people more prosocial?

I present an experimental test of whether philosophers' and theologians' argument analyses are influenced by religious commitments. The empirical findings suggest that religious belief affects philosophical analysis and offer a challenge to theists and atheists, alike: re-evaluate the scope of natural theology's conclusions or acknowledge and begin to address the influence of religious belief. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","expertise; intuition; methodology; modal ontological argument; natural theology; ontological argument; philosophy of religion; theology",,"Bishop, J., (2007) Believing by faith: An essay in the epistemology and ethics of religious belief, , New York, NY: Clarendon Press; Braine, D., (1988) The reality of time and the existence of God: The project of proving god’s existence, , Oxford: Clarendon Press; Chalmers, D., Bourget, D., What do philosophers believe?

Previous research demonstrates that euphoric individuals think more broadly and schematically, and that dysphoric individuals are more focused and details-oriented. We investigated the effect of mood on analogical transfer in four conditions: (1) expert euphoric; (2) expert dysphoric; (3) nonexpert euphoric; and (4) nonexpert dysphoric. Mood was induced from watching a 10-minute video (a comedy excerpt to induce euphoria; a realistic depiction of nuclear war for dysphoria). The affect grid was used for a manipulation check. In expert conditions, participants first played the five-disk Tower of Hanoi (TOH) game, followed by the Bear God (BG) task, a new isomorph of TOH (same rules, different surface features). Participants were not told about the hidden isomorphism. In nonexpert conditions, participants played an unrelated game first. Based on prior literature, it would be possible that dysphoria could either hamper or enhance analogical reasoning. We found evidence for the latter – superior performance in the dysphoric BG task – but only in the expert condition. The implication for religion is that expertise and dysphoria have special cognitive functions in ritual. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","analogy; anxiety; emotion; mood; religion; ritual; thinking; Tower of Hanoi",,"Alcorta, C.S., Sosis, R., Ritual, emotion, and sacred symbols: The evolution of religion as an adaptive complex (2005) Human Nature, 16, pp. 323-359; Atkinson, Q.D., Whitehouse, H., The cultural morphospace of ritual form: Examining modes of religiosity cross-culturally (2011) Evolution and Human Behaviour, 32, pp. 50-62; Azari, N.P., Birnbacher, D., The role of cognition in religious experience (2004) Zygon, 39, pp. 901-918; Azari, N.P., Missimer, J., Seitz, R.J., Religious experience and emotion: Evidence for distinctive cognitive neural patterns (2005) International Journal for the Psychology of Religion, 15, pp. 263-281; Bartlett, A., Nuclear warfare in the movies (2004) Anthropoetics, 10. , http://www.anthropoetics.ucla.edu/, Retrieved from; Beedie, C.J., Terry, P.C., Lane, A.M., Distinctions between emotion and mood (2005) Cognition and Emotion, 19, pp. 847-878; Bell, C., (1997) Ritual: Perspectives and dimensions, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Beukeboom, C.J., Semin, G.R., Mood and representations of behaviour: The how and why (2005) Cognition and Emotion, 19, pp. 1242-1251; Bless, H., Clore, G.L., Schwarz, N., Golisano, V., Rabe, C., Wölk, M., Mood and the use of scripts: Does a happy mood really lead to mindlessness?

Tobit regression models adjusted for the following potentially confounding demographic factors: gender differences, age, majority ethnic group membership, household income (log), education, parental status, relationship status, and political orientation. Adjusting for these other factors, the residual difference between religious and non-religious people in life satisfaction was fully accounted for by corresponding differences in the amount a person donates to charity. Given the diversity and size of our sample, and our use of strict demographic controls, our results are consistent with a model in which religious people experience greater life satisfaction because they also tend to give more to charity. Our findings thus imply that charitable giving, rather than religious affiliation per se, is a proximate predictor of life satisfaction in New Zealand. This study replicates and extends similar models tested in the USA, and shows that increasing charity, whether or not one is religious, may be a vital pathway to human flourishing. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","Charity; Happiness; Life satisfaction; Religion; Secular; Well-being",,"Borgonovi, F., Doing well by doing good.

Building from a recent theoretical model, I predict that social hierarchies influence the cultural evolution of ritual systems and explain substantial intracultural variation in ritual behavior. The present work investigates these predictions using historical data and an analysis of observational and ethnographic interview data collected in a contemporary Fijian village. Historical data indicate that status differences between Fijians and missionaries and those between chiefs and commoners influenced the nature of Fijian religion and the socio- ecological environment in which contemporary ritual behavior takes place. Contemporary Fijian ritual life includes participation in Christian church services, and also kava-drinking ceremonies that evolved from the indigenous religion. Observational data reveal that performance within each ritual format is significantly influenced by the age and ascribed status differences of participants, and that high-ranking men are more likely to attend church services while low-ranking men are more likely to attend kava ceremonies. Moreover, a man’s ascribed status significantly predicts his achieved role in the church, with higher-ranking men more likely to be lay preachers, and low- ranking men more likely to be members of the choir. These findings point to the importance of developing multilevel approaches to the study of religion and suggest that social inequality exerts an important influence on the cultural evolution of ritual systems. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","Fiji; Intracultural variation; Religion; Ritual; Social hierarchies",,"Akaike, H., A new look at the statistical model identification (1974) IEEE Transactions Onautomatic Control, 19, pp. 716-723; Bourdieu, P., (1977) Outline of a Theory of Practice, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Bourdieu, P., Genesis and structures of the religious field (1991) Comparative Social Research, 13, pp. 1-43; Brison, K., (2007) Our Wealth is Loving Each Other: Self and Society in Fiji, , Lanham, MD:Lexington Books; Cronk, L., Evolutionary theories of morality and the manipulative use of signals (1994) Zygonjournal of Religion and Science, 29, pp. 81-101; De Aguiar, R., Cronk, L., Stratification and supernatural punishment: Cooperation orobedience?

With this alteration in consciousness, some persons report unusual experiences that have been thought to resemble spontaneous mystical experiences. This study was designed to identify and characterize the mystical experiences associated with seizure activity, through the use of a quantitative instrument with well-documented reliability and validity for assessing the content and quality of mystical states of consciousness. Ninety-eight patients with epilepsy completed a modified version of the Mysticism Scale, of whom 86 had EEGs recorded. Fifty-five per cent of the patients in this study recalled some subjective experience in association with their seizures. However, none of the patients’ descriptions met the criteria for mystical experience. Although some features of mystical experience were reported in this study, particularly those suggestive of introvertive mysticism, they were not associated with any particular lobe of the brain nor were they lateralized to either the right or left side. Mysticism Scale scores were not significantly associated with demographics, medical history including seizure risk factors and precipitants, or seizure characteristics including localization and type of seizure. ï¿½ 2014, Taylor & Francis.","Altered consciousness;

The neurotransmitters dopamine and endogenous opiates play interactive roles in these processes. They are released by natural rewards (i.e., food, water, sex, money, play, etc.) and are released or mimicked by drugs of abuse. Repeated drug use induces conditioned down-regulation of these neurotransmitters, thus causing painful suppression of everyday pleasure. As with many spiritual traditions, Buddhism provides strong advice against the pursuit of worldly pleasures to attain the “good life.” In contrast, many forms of meditation give rise to an immense and abiding joy. Most of these practices involve “stilling the mind,” whereby all content-laden thought (e.g., fantasies, daydreams, plans) ceases, and the mind enters a state of openness, formlessness, clarity, and bliss. This can be explained by the Buddhist suggestion that almost all of our everyday thoughts are a form of addiction. It follows that if we turn off this internal “gossip of ego,” we will find relief from the biochemical dopamine/opiate down-regulation, which is, perhaps, the perpetual concomitant of our daily rumination. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","bliss; Buddhism; default mode network; dopamine; meditation; mind wandering; nucleus accumbens; prediction error",,"Alexander, G.E., Crutcher, M.D., Functional architecture of basal ganglia circuits: Neural substrates of parallel processing (1990) Trends in Neuroscience, 13, pp. 266-271; Austin, H., (2006) Zen-brain reflections, , Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press; Benson, H., Lehman, J.W., Malhotra, M.S., Goldman, R.F., Hopkins, J., Epstein, M.D., Body temperature changes during the practice of g Tum-mo yoga (1982) Nature, 295, pp. 234-236; Berridge, K.C., The debate over dopamine's role in reward: The case for incentive salience (2007) Psychopharmacology, 191, pp. 391-431; Berridge, K.C., Robinson, T.E., What is the role of dopamine in reward: Hedonic impact, reward learning, or incentive salience (1998) Brain Research Reviews, 28, pp. 309-369; Bigelsen, J., Schupak, C., Compulsive fantasy: Proposed evidence of an under-reported syndrome through a systematic study of 90 self-identified non-normative fantasizers (2011) Consciousness and Cognition, 20, pp. 1634-1648; Brewer, J.A., Worhunsky, P.D., Gray, J.R., Tang, Y.Y., Weber, J., Kober, H., Meditation experience is associated with differences in default mode network activity and connectivity (2011) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA, 108, pp. 20254-20259; Buckner, R.L., Andrews-Hanna, J.R., Schacter, D.L., The brain's default network: Anatomy, function, and relevance to disease (2008) Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 1124, pp. 1-38; Buzsáki, G., (2006) Rhythms of the brain, , New York: Oxford University Press; Cahn, B.R., Polich, J., Meditation states and traits: EEG, ERP, and neuroimaging studies (2006) Psychological Bulletin, 132, pp. 180-211; Carroll, J., (1987) The basketball diaries, , London: Penguin Books; Chalmers, D.J., Facing up to the problem of consciousness (1995) Journal of Consciousness Studies, 2, pp. 200-219; Chalmers, D.J., (1996) The conscious mind: In search of a fundamental theory, , New York: Oxford University Press; Chodron, P., (2010) The three commitments: Working with the path of liberation.

In the present study, we examined whether people are also cognitively biased to explain naturally occurring events in terms of inherent purpose (i.e., mistakenly attributing intentional design behind naturally caused life events), and if so, how explicit religious beliefs may interact with this implicit bias. A semi-structured interview was conducted concerning important autobiographical events. Overall, results indicated that differing levels of cultural religiosity (i.e., whether participants were from the relatively religious USA or the relatively secular UK) did not affect the tendency to reason teleologically. As predicted, explicit religious beliefs had an effect in that atheists gave significantly fewer teleological explanations than theists; however, half the atheists (n=17) gave at least one teleological response and more than three-quarters (n=26) gave a teleological response or admitted feeling conflicted between teleological intuitions and more rational, naturalistic explanations for significant life events. We interpret these results as suggesting that basic theory-of-mind competencies underlie the propensity to reason teleologically about major life events. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","atheism; teleology; theory of mind",,"Aarnio, K., Lindeman, M., Paranormal beliefs, education, and thinking styles (2005) Personality and Individual Differences, 39, pp. 1227-1236; Aarnio, K., Lindeman, M., Religious people and paranormal believers: Alike or different?

The current study attempted to replicate these results using 23 individuals with diagnosed seizure disorders. Neuropsychological tests of bilateral frontal, temporal, and parietal lobe functioning were used as indices of cerebral integrity and correlated with a self-report measure of forgiveness. Results indicated that frontal lobe and RPL functions were significantly and negatively correlated with forgiveness. A forward linear regression indicated that only RPL functions predict unique variance in forgiveness. The results support a neuropsychological model of forgiveness that suggests it is related to: (1) decreased self-orientation associated with decreased RPL function, which is experienced as a decreased focus on the perceived wrong to the self; and (2) decreased attention associated with decreased frontal lobe functioning, which is experienced as decreased rumination associated with feeling wronged.

This neglect may be the result of a widespread assumption that value is constructed, that is, a special quality added to sensory input by the mind. However, such a view not only divorces value from meaning, but it also cannot register the ways in which value is discovered and enriched through skillful engagement. Accordingly, it is proposed that the experience of value is better understood in ecological terms, as the richness of meaningful interaction between a skilled perceiver and a suitably complex environment. An ecological approach opens up new opportunities for the investigation of the environmental conditions of value-rich religious experience. For example, it may be possible to determine how the experience of divine presence is supported by the structural features of music used in religious settings. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","Ecological psychology; James Gibson; Perception; Religious experience; Value",,"Abram, D., (1996) The Spell of the Sensuous: Perception and Language In a More-than-human World, , New York: Pantheon Books; Alexander, T., (1985) John Dewey's Theory of Art, Experience, and Nature: The Horizons of Feeling, , Albany, NY: SUNY Press; Alston, W.P., (1991) Perceiving God: The Epistemology of Religious Experience, , Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press; Alston, W.P., (1993) The Reliability of Sense Perception, , Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press; Barrett, N.F., Skillful engagement and the 'effort after meaning and value': An axiological theory of the origins of religion Cognitive Approaches to The Evolution of Religion: Critical Perspectives, , forthcoming, In F.

Participants were part of a broad movement in modern Christianity that goes by various terms such as Pentecostal, charismatic, or spirit-filled. For them, the presence of God is a strong and immediate experience during improvised, personal prayer. Prayer was compared to imaginatively speaking to a loved one, a significant other in the person's life, and to a ground state of visualizing and naming a parade of animals. Results show an overlap between prayer and speaking to a loved one in brain areas associated with theory of mind, suggesting that the brain treats both as an interpersonal relationship. These brain areas are also associated with the default mode network, where the mind evaluates past and possible future experiences of the self. It is suggested that the high personal significance that participants attach to prayer experiences is due in part to their taking place in core areas of self-understanding. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","Christianity; Default mode network; FMRI; Prayer; Self; Theory of mind",,"Abraham, A., von Cramon, D.Y., Schubotz, R.I., Meeting George Bush versus meeting Cinderella: The neural response when telling apart what is real from what is fictional in the context of our reality (2008) Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 20, pp. 965-976; Amodio, D.M., Frith, C.D., Meeting of minds: The medial frontal cortex and social cognition (2006) Nature Reviews Neuroscience, 7, pp. 268-277; Andrews-Hanna, J.R., The brain's default network and its adaptive role in internal mentation (2012) Neuroscientist, 18, pp. 251-270; Andrews-Hanna, J.R., Reidler, J.S., Huang, C., Buckner, R.L., Evidence for the default network's role in spontaneous cognition (2010) Journal of Neurophysiology, 104, pp. 322-335; (2006) American Piety In the 21st Century, , http://www.baylor.edu/content/services/document.php/33304.pdf, Baylor Religion Survey; Beauregard, M., Paquette, V., Neural correlates of a mystical experience in Carmelite nuns (2006) Neuroscience Letters, 405, pp. 186-190; Benoit, R.G., Gilbert, S.J., Volle, E., Burgess, P.W., When I think about me and simulate you: Medial rostral prefrontal cortex and self-referential processes (2010) Neuroimage, 50, pp. 1340-1349; Buckner, R.L., The serendipitous discoveryofthe brain's default network (2012) Neuroimage, 62, pp. 1137-1145; Buckner, R.L., Andrews-Hanna, J.R., Schacter, D.L., The brain's default network: Anatomy, function, and relevance to disease (2008) Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 1124, pp. 1-38; Cox, H.G., (1995) Fire From Heaven: The Rise of Pentecostal Spirituality and the Reshaping of Religion In the Twenty-first Century, , Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley; D'Argembeau, A., Jedidi, H., Balteau, E., Bahri, M., Phillips, C., Salmon, E., Valuing one's self: Medial prefrontal involvement in epistemic and emotive investments in self-views (2012) Cerebral Cortex, 22, pp. 659-667; D'Argembeau, A., Lardi, C., Van der Linden, M., Self-defining future projections: Exploring the identity function of thinking about the future (2012) Memory, 20, pp. 110-120; Daselaar, S.M., Porat, Y., Huijbers, W., Pennartz, C.M., Modality-specific and modality-independent components of the human imagery system (2010) Neuroimage, 52, pp. 677-685; Grim, B.J., Pentecostalism's growth in religiously restricted environments (2009) Society, 46, pp. 484-495; Harris, S., Sheth, S.A., Cohen, M.S., Functional neuroimaging of belief, disbelief, and uncertainty (2008) Annals of Neurology, 63, pp. 141-147; Hassabis, D., Kumaran, D., Maguire, E.A., Using imagination to understand the neural basis of episodic memory (2007) Journal of Neuroscience, 27, pp. 14365-14374; James, W., (1985) The Varieties of Religious Experience, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.

Recent studies using economic game experiments to explore this issue have been largely inconclusive, yielding a range of conflicting results. In this study, we investigate the ability of religion to promote cooperation by using explicit theological primes. In the first study, conducted in a church, we find that subjects who report a stronger connection with a Christian passage about charitable giving are subsequently more likely to cooperate in a one-shot prisoner's dilemma game. In the second study, conducted over the Internet, we find that Christian subjects are more likely to cooperate after reading a Christian passage than a neutral one. However, in the same study, we find that Hindu and secular passages have no significant effect on Christians, and that none of the passages (Christian, Hindu, or secular) have an effect on non-Christians. Our results show the potential power of explicitly religious exhortations that promote cooperation, and also their selectivity. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","Prisoner's dilemma; Prosociality; Religiosity; Theological priming",,"Abarbanell, L., Hauser, M.D., Mayan morality: An exploration of permissible harms (2010) Cognition, 115, pp. 207-224; Ahmed, A.M., Salas, O., Implicit influences of Christian religious representations on dictator and prisoner's dilemma game decisions (2011) Journal of Socio-Economics, 40, pp. 242-246; Akay, A., Karabulut, G., Martinsson, P., The effect of religiosity and religious festivals on positional concerns: An experimental investigation of Ramadan (2013) Applied Economics, 45, pp. 3914-3921; Amir, O., Rand, D.G., Gal, Y.K., Economic games on the Internet: The effect of $1 stakes (2012) PLoS ONE, 7, pp. e31461; Antal, T., Ohtsuki, H., Wakeley, J., Taylor, P.D., Nowak, M.A., Evolution of cooperation by phenotypic similarity (2009) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 106, pp. 8597-8600; Atran, S., Henrich, J., The evolution of religion: How cognitive by-products, adaptive learning heuristics, ritual displays, and group competition generate deep commitments to prosocial religions (2010) Biological Theory, 5, pp. 18-30; Atran, S., Norenzayan, A., Religion's evolutionary landscape: Counterintuition, commitment, compassion, communion (2004) Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 27, pp. 713-770; Benjamin, D.J., Choi, J.J., Fisher, G., (2010) Religious identity and economic behavior, pp. 1-28. , NBER Working Paper Series, 15925; Bering, J.M., Johnson, D.D.P., ""O Lord you perceive my thoughts from afar:"" Recursiveness and the evolution of supernatural agency (2005) Journal of Cognition and Culture, 5, pp. 118-142; Bernhard, H., Fischbacher, U., Fehr, E., Parochial altruism in humans (2006) Nature, 442, pp. 912-915; Bohnet, I., Frey, B.S., The sound of silence in prisoner's dilemma and dictator games (1999) Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization, 38, pp. 43-57; Brewer, M.B., In-group bias in the minimal intergroup situation: A cognitive-motivational analysis (1979) Psychological Bulletin, 86, pp. 307-324; Buhrmester, M.D., Kwang, T., Gosling, S.D., Amazon's Mechanical Turk: A new source of inexpensive, yet high-quality, data?

We identified five patterns of belief, which we call faith signatures, reflecting distinct combinations of high or low belief in different religious teachings and paranormal phenomena. Although conventional wisdom pits agnostics against religious believers, we found that undifferentiated skeptics (41%) and religious exclusives (12%) expressed similarly high levels of disbelief for most types of paranormal phenomena, with religious exclusives showing traditional religious beliefs only. Also, we found striking similarities between undifferentiated believers (9%), New Age spiritualists (13%), and moderate agnostics (25%), all of whom accorded belief to supernatural realities across a number of religious and paranormal phenomena. However, only undifferentiated believers committed to the truth of superstitions. Importantly, we also found that faith signatures are reliably associated with demographic variables and core psychological traits (anomie, trust, and happiness). Thus, LCA reveals that the classifications ""religious"" and ""secular"" obscure subtleties in distinct categories of supernatural orientations. Furthermore, by scratching the surface of what appears to be a highly secular society, our results challenge conventional distinctions between religious and secular orientations. The key distinction is not between belief and disbelief but rather between levels of discrimination in different types of belief. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","Anomie; Cognition; Latent class analysis; Paranormal; Religion; Secularization",,"Aarnio, K., Lindeman, M., Religious people and paranormal believers: Alike or different?

Although recent studies have demonstrated that synchrony promotes prosociality, it remains unclear whether prosociality extends to targets outside the synchronous group. Studies on the related phenomenon of mimicry (i.e., the non-conscious imitation of another's behavior) show that matching behavior in form amplifies prosociality to those outside the mimicked pair. While these studies suggest that synchrony might also evoke generalized prosociality, the minimal group paradigm predicts that any increase in prosoci-ality will be confined to synchronous performers. Study 1 investigated the cooperative specificity of synchrony by comparing the effects of synchrony on prosociality directed to co-performers and to non-performers. We found that synchrony-induced prosociality was not restricted to fellow synchronous performers. These findings offer initial support for a generalized prosocial model of synchronous performances. Study 2 investigated whether generalized prosociality occurred when the prosocial target was conceived as another group, rather than another individual. Consistent with the first study, we found that synchronous movements were associated with greater prosociality towards a non-performance group when compared to the level of prosociality observed from the control group activity. Collectively these findings offer initial support that synchrony may amplify prosociality to non-participants, whether conceived as individuals or as groups. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","Cooperation; Dance; Music; Prosocial; Rhythm; Ritual",,"Aron, A., Aron, E.N., Smollan, D., Inclusion of other in the self scale and the structure of interpersonal closeness (1992) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 63 (4), pp. 596-612; Ashton-James, C., van Baaren, R.B., Chartrand, T.L., Decety, J., Karremans, J., Mimicry and me: The impact of mimicry on self-construal (2007) Social Cognition, 25 (4), pp. 518-535; Barsalou, L.W., Niedenthal, P.M., Barbey, A., Ruppert, J., Social embodiment (2003) The Psychology of Learning and Motivation, pp. 43-92. , In B.

We report the results of an experiment that investigated the effects of religious-concept priming and synchronous activity among Brazilian drummers. Participants were divided into two between-subjects narrative priming conditions: religious and secular. Within each priming condition, we applied a within-subjects design to investigate effects of solo, group synchronous, and group non-synchronous drumming on endorphin release and cooperation. We found an effect of priming conditions, such that there was a trend toward higher cooperation in the religiously primed group compared to the secularly primed group. We found neither a main effect of the drumming condition nor a drumming-priming interaction effect. Results suggest that behavioral synchrony alone is insufficient to increase cooperation. In light of previous findings, we propose that high levels of physical exertion or social-cognitive mechanisms, such as overlapping task-representation or intentional coordination, are also required for cooperation. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","Brazil; Cooperation; Drumming; Endorphin; Music; Synchrony",,"Atkinson, Q.D., Bourrat, P., Beliefs about God, the afterlife, and morality support the role of supernatural policing in human cooperation (2011) Evolution and Human Behavior, 32, pp. 41-49; Barrett, J.L., Keil, F.C., Conceptualizing a non-natural entity: Anthropomorphism in God concepts (1996) Cognitive Psychology, 31, pp. 219-247; Bering, J., McLeod, K., Shackelford, T.K., Reasoning about dead agents reveals possible adaptive trends (2005) Human Nature, 16, pp. 360-381; Boecker, H., Sprenger, T., Spilker, M.E., Henriksen, G., Koppenhoefer, M., Wagner, K.J., Valet, M., Tolle, T.R., The runner's high: Opioidergic mechanisms in the human brain (2008) Cerebral Cortex, 18, pp. 2523-2531; Cohen, E., (2007) The Mind Possessed: The Cognition of Spirit Possession In An Afro-Brazilian Religious Tradition, , New York: Oxford University Press; Cohen, E., Ejsmond-Frey, R., Knight, N., Dunbar, R.I.M., Rowers' high: Behavioural synchrony is correlated with elevated pain thresholds (2010) Biology Letters, 6, pp. 106-108; Dunbar, R.I.M., Language, music, and laughter in evolutionary perspective (2004) Evolution of Communicative Systems: A Comparative Approach, pp. 257-274. , D.K.

In this paper I discuss the different ways in which this uniformity is achieved, the advantages and disadvantages that cultural uniformity offers a group, and the broader effects of cultural uniformity on cultural evolution. Partial cultural uniformity can come about in different ways, including: (1) selection involving positive and negative feedbacks (e.g., Fisher process); (2) coordinating signals that include hard-to-fake displays; and (3) the imposition of protocols that are necessarily similar enough to enable communication. These processes often interact, resulting in rapid uniformity in some aspects of culture. Once a sufficient level of cultural uniformity is achieved, it has important consequences for the group as a whole and for individual members. These include: (1) credible signaling which is not costly; (2) increased detection of deviant or novel behavior; (3) increased group cohesion and commitment; (4) an agreedupon central authority that can divide labor and direct group-wide cultural change; and (5) an increase in the rate of adaptation due to cultural group selection. These effects help explain the stability and diversity of religious group practices. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","Cultural evolution; Cultural uniformity; Culture; Evolution; Religion",,"Alcorta, C., Sosis, R., Religion, emotion, and symbolic ritual: The evolution of an adaptive complex (2005) Human Nature, 16, pp. 323-359; Asch, S.E., Effects of group pressure upon the modification and distortion of judgments (1951) Groups, leadership and men, pp. 177-190. , In H.

The present study addressed this gap by testing the predictions of deprivation theory using a large (n=6,518) national probability sample of New Zealanders. A key innovation of our study is the use of an objective index of neighborhood deprivation derived from a Principle Components Analysis of New Zealand Census data. Consistent with deprivation theory, we found that neighborhood deprivation predicted religious identification, but not religious affiliation. Adding education to the model improved fit, but did not attenuate the effect of deprivation. Importantly, the addition of ethnicity to the deprivation model produced a better fit for predicting the strength of religious identification. These results suggest a role for cultural inheritance in explaining the mechanisms by which religious identity and religious affiliation are related to each other, and over time. Finally, we consider these findings through a discussion that integrates evolutionary models of religion with the sociological model of deprivation theory. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","Culture; Deprivation theory; Ethnicity; Identity",,"Alcorta, C.S., Sosis, R., Ritual, emotion, and sacred symbols: The evolution of religion as an adaptive complex (2005) Human Nature, 16 (4), pp. 323-359; Atran, S., (2002) In gods we trust: The evolutionary landscape of religion, , New York: Oxford University Press; Blakely, T., Socioeconomic position is more than just NZDEP (2002) New Zealand Medical Journal, 115 (1149), pp. 109-111; Boomsma, D., Busjahn, A., Peltonen, L., Classical twin studies and beyond (2002) Nature Reviews: Genetics, 3 (11), pp. 872-882; Boyer, P., Lienard, P., Precaution systems and ritualized behavior (2006) Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 29 (6), pp. 635-650; Bradshaw, M., Ellison, C., Financial hardship and psychological distress: Exploring the buffering effects of religion (2010) Social Science and Medicine, 71 (1), pp. 196-204; Bulbulia, J., Meme infection or religious niche construction?

However, the scope of value leveling remains uncertain. We conducted a natural experiment by using the resilience of conservative values among religious residents to evaluate the extent of leveling in the conservative values of nonreligious neighbors. We employed a Multi-level Random Coefficient Model that linked survey data on religious/value orientations from a nationally representative sample of New Zealanders (n=6217 people) with census data on the proportion of religious people living in respondent neighborhoods. Consistent with the religious valueleveling hypothesis, the conservative values of religious residents predicted levels of conservative values among nonreligious neighbors. The strength of conservative values leveling among nonreligious neighbors was found to be a linear function of the proportion of religious residents. This pattern appeared consistently across New Zealand, and held controlling for demographic variables and regional deprivation. No other value domain besides conservative values exhibited such frequency-dependent leveling effects. This study offers the first demonstration of value leveling at a national scale. It reveals that proportionally dense religious populations may affect the value orientations of nonreligious neighbors, even in a mainly secular country. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","Culture; Geography; Morality; Religion; Secularization; Social networks",,"Aiken, L.S., West, S.G., (1991) Multiple regression: Testing and interpreting interactions, , London: SAGE; Bering, J.M., McLeod, K., Shackelforth, T.K., Reasoning about dead agents reveals possible adaptive trends (2005) Human Nature, 16, pp. 360-381; Binmore, K., Why do people cooperate?

In light of such studies, we wondered whether religious rituals of atonement and absolution are, from the perspective of religious groups, counterproductive mechanisms for addressing the moral transgressions of group members. If sin is a form of capital, might absolution rituals squander that capital? We found that Catholic participants who recalled committing a past sin and being absolved of it donated significantly more money to the church than those who recalled committing the sin but had not yet recalled being absolved of it. This effect was more pronounced the more participants believed in divine judgment and the more they engaged in religious activities such as reading the bible or praying. Our findings indicate that the Catholic ritual of confession is an effective means of promoting commitment to the church. These results complement a cultural evolutionary approach to religious prosociality, whereby religious practices evolve to the extent they contribute to high levels of cooperation in religious groups. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","Absolution rituals; Catholic confession; Cooperation; Cultural evolution; Guilt; Morality; Prosocial behavior; Religion",,"Ahmed, A.M., Salas, O., Implicit influences of Christian religious representations on dictator and prisoner's dilemma game decisions (2011) Journal of Socio-Economics, 40, pp. 242-246; Amodio, D.M., Devine, P.G., Harmon-Jones, E., A dynamic model of guilt: Implications for motivation and self-regulation in the context of prejudice (2007) Psychological Science, 18, pp. 524-530; Bernhard, H., Fischbacher, U., Fehr, E., Parochial altruism in humans (2006) Nature, 442, pp. 912-915; (2000) Catechism of the Catholic Church: Second edition, , Catholic Church, Vatican: Libreria Editrice Vaticana; Choi, J.K., Bowles, S., The coevolution of parochial altruism and war (2007) Science, 318, pp. 636-640; De Dreu, C.K.W., Greer, L.L., Handgraaf, M.J.J., Shalvi, S., Van Kleef, G.A., Baas, M., The neuropeptide oxytocin regulates parochial altruism in intergroup conflict among humans (2010) Science, 328, pp. 1408-1411; De Hooge, I.E., Zeelenberg, M., Breugelmans, S.M., Moral sentiments and cooperation: Differential influences of shame and guilt (2007) Cognition and Emotion, 21, pp. 1025-1042; Durosaro, I.A., Ajiboye, S.K., Olawuyi, O., Adebanke, N.M., Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT): A counseling intervention for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among internally displaced persons (IDPs) (2012) European Journal of Social Sciences, 29 (2), pp. 188-193; Jordan, J., Mullen, E., Murnighan, J.K., Striving for the moral self: The effects of recalling past moral actions on future moral behavior (2011) Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 37, pp. 701-713; Ketelaar, T., Au, W.T., The effects of guilty feelings on the behavior of uncooperative individuals in repeated social bargaining games: An affect-as-information interpretation of the role of emotion in social interaction (2003) Cognition and Emotion, 17, pp. 429-453; Lee, S.W.S., Schwarz, N., Wiping the slate clean: Psychological consequences of physical cleansing (2011) Current Directions in Psychological Science, 20, pp. 307-311; Mazar, N., Amir, O., Ariely, D., The dishonesty of honest people: A theory of self-concept maintenance (2008) Journal of Marketing Research, 45, pp. 633-644; Norenzayan, A., Gervais, W., The cultural evolution of religion (2012) Creating consilience: Integrating science and the humanities, , In E.

The assumptions will be treated collectively as the ""tempor-olimbic model"" of mystical experience. The discrepancy in the prevalence of ecstatic seizures and of mystical experience is discussed. A theory exemplifying the temporolimbic model is critiqued. Emotion in mystical experience is compared with ictal affect and ictal pleasure. A phenomenological analysis of a mystical account written by Symeon the New Theologian (AD 949-1022) is presented as a counterexample to the temporolimbic model. The conclusion is that the temporolimbic model is inadequate for explaining the actual features of mystical experience, and particularly ill-suited for identifying and describing emotion in mystical experience. Future studies in the neuropsychology of mystical experience would benefit from adopting an interdisciplinary approach that incorporates the analysis of traditional mystical accounts. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","Deification; Ecstatic seizure; Maximos; Mysticism; Neuropathography; Neurotheology; Symeon the new theologian; Temporal lobe",,"Alajouanine, T., Dostoiewski's epilepsy (1963) Brain, 86, pp. 210-218; Altschuler, E.L., Did Ezekiel have temporal lobe epilepsy?

Studies show that religiosity is correlated with self-reported prosociality; however, this relationship is not very clear when it comes to observed prosocial behaviors. Experimental studies reveal a link between religious priming and prosocial behaviors, and these effects are evident irrespective of the degree of religiosity of the participant. Building on and combining the strengths of previous field designs, I report on the results of a field experiment in Mauritius examining the effects of religious environments on cooperation in a naturalistic setting. These results were consistent with previous findings that religious cues increase cooperation. Importantly, this effect was not dependent on degrees of prior religiosity. Plausible interpretations of such effects are discussed. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","Cooperation; Experimental anthropology; Mauritius; Prosociality; Religion",,"Ahmed, A.M., Are religious people more prosocial-A quasi-experimental study with Madrasah pupils in a rural community in India (2009) Journal For the Scientific Study of Religion, 48 (2), pp. 368-374; Ahmed, A.M., Salas, O., (2008) In the Back of Your Mind: Subliminal Influences of Religious Concepts On Prosocial Behavior, , Working Papers in Economics 331.

Using a cognitive resource model of executive function, we argue that these three features affect the executive system in ways that limit the capacity for individual processing of religious events. We frame our analysis in the context of a general assumption that collective rituals facilitate the transmission of cultural ideas. Building on recent experiments, we suggest that these three features increase participants' susceptibility to authoritative narratives and interpretations by preventing individuals from constructing their own accounts of the ritual event. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","Authority; Emotion regulation; Predictive coding; Resource depletion; Ritualized behavior",,"Alvarez, J.A., Emory, E., Executive function and the frontal lobes: A meta-analytic review (2006) Neuropsychology Review, 16, pp. 17-42; Aronson, E., Mills, J., The effect of severity of intitiation on liking for a group (1959) Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, 59, pp. 177-181; Balgrove, M., Effects of length of sleep deprivation on interrogative suggestibility (1996) Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied, 2 (1), pp. 48-59; Bar, M., Predictions: A universal principle in the operation of the human brain (2009) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 364 (1521), pp. 1181-1182; Barker, E., Charismatization: The social production of an ethos propitious to the mobilisation of sentiments (1993) Secularization, Rationalism and Sectarianism, pp. 181-202. , In E.

These cooperative activities sometimes involve coordinated acts of violence, particularly against religious out-groups. Using phylogenetic and social network analyses, we investigated whether religious violence is inherited from parent congregations or is acquired from contempora-neous purveyors of violent ideologies. We examined these questions among sixteenth-century Anabaptists, who constitute a prominent historical system with both violent and pacifist congregations. We found that ideology advocating violence was typically inherited from parent congregations, while the majority of other theological traits spread among contemporaneous groups. Violent ideology may be learned independently from most other characteristics of an overall belief system, and/or it may be determined more by congregationally inherited economic and political factors than by theology. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","Cultural phylogeny; Ideology; In-group; Religion; Social networks; Violence",,"Atran, S., Genesis of suicide terrorism (2003) Science, 299, pp. 1534-1539; Berman, E., (2009) Radical, Religious, and Violent: The New Economics of Terrorism, , Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Butts, C.T., (2010) Sna: Tools For Social Network Analysis, , http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sna, Package version 2.2-0.

Narratives that survive repeated horizontal and/or vertical transmissions are those that have a selection advantage- they are superior attractors of attention. One particularly durable narrative concerns certain events of the late-sixteenth-century Council of Trent. According to legend, the Council was on the verge of banning polyphonic music from the Catholic Mass, but desisted upon hearing Palestrina's Missa Papae Marcelli. This paper demonstrates that this legend is essentially unsupported by the historical record, describes the cumulative evolution of a Palestrina Myth from c. 1607, and posits that the resilience of the myth lies in its tacit acknowledgement that polyphony represents a violation of expectations for doctrinal rituals as described by Whitehouse's Modes of Religiosity theory. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","Aesthetics; Cognition; Cultural evolution; Music; Narratives; Palestrina; Religion",,"(1979) The Transformations of Lucius, Otherwise Known As ""the Golden Ass"", , Apuleius, (R.

Only after a second reading did I begin to discern the importance of ‘‘absential features’’ for Deacon’s view of emergence, although I am still not convinced that they accomplish their assigned task. Undoubtedly, further readings would bring me even closer to his position, but time restrictions require that I offer this response with my current understanding, however incomplete it is. In what follows, I will focus on the philosophical dimensions of Deacon’s argument, especially his ‘‘negative approach to realism’’ (p. 191). My commentary will thus begin with a discussion of the special explanatory demands of emergence and then consider how Deacon uses ‘‘absential features’’ to meet those demands. ©2013 Taylor & Francis.",,,"Deacon, T.W., (2012) Incomplete nature: How mind emerged from nature, , New York: W.W.

Previous evidence suggests that distrust of atheists is in part the result of believers thinking that being under supernatural surveillance by a watchful God underlies moral behavior. However, secular rule of law, including institutions such as police, judges, and courts, are also potent sources of prosocial behavior in some parts of the world. The presence of such secular authority therefore could replace religion’s prosocial role and erode believers’ rejection of atheists. In two complementary cross-national analyses, we found support for this hypothesis: believers from countries with a strong secular rule of law showed markedly reduced political intolerance of atheists compared to believers from countries with a weak secular rule of law. This relationship remained strong after controlling for individual demographic characteristics and several country-level socio-economic predictors of atheist distrust, such as human development, individualism, religious involvement, and distrust of people in general. ©2013 Taylor & Francis.","Atheism; God; Government; Prejudice; Religious beliefs; Trust",,"Axelrod, R., (1984) The evolution of cooperation, , Cambridge, MA: Basic Books; Bateson, M., Nettle, D., Roberts, G., Cues of being watched enhance cooperation in a real-world setting (2006) Biology Letters, 2, pp. 412-414; Bering, J., (2011) The belief instinct: The psychology of souls, destiny, and the meaning of life, , New York: Norton; Bulbulia, J., Sosis, R., Signalling theory and the evolutionary study of religions (2011) Religion, 41, pp. 363-388; Cottrell, C.A., Neuberg, S.L., Li, N.P., What do people desire in others?

Using New Zealand census data from 1966-2006, we develop a Bayesian predictive model to forecast the proportion of the population identifying as Christian in the future. A surprisingly simple linear model revealed that Christian affiliation in New Zealand has been steadily declining at a constant rate of around 0.90% per year since 1966. The model explained 97.4% of the variance in proportional change in the New Zealand Christian population over the past halfcentury. The model also offers testable predictions. We estimate that 46.1% of the population will identify as Christian in New Zealand in 2015, with a further decline to 41.7% by 2020. The 95% credible interval for the 2015 estimate is between 42.5% and 49.6%. The 95% credible interval for the 2020 estimate is between 37.7% and 45.8%.We consider both the strengths of this Bayesian crystal ball and its potential limitations. ©2013 Taylor & Francis.","Bayesian models; Christianity; Forecasting; New Zealand; Religious change",,"Berger, P., Luckmann, T., (1966) The social construction of reality: A treatise in the sociology of knowledge, , New York: Doubleday; Berger, P., (1990) The sacred canopy: Elements of a sociological theory of religion, , New York: Doubleday; Berger, P., (1999) The desecularization of the world, , Washington, DC: Ethics and Public Policy Center; Blume, M., (2009) The reproductive benefits of religious affiliation, , Berlin: Springer-Verlag; Bulbulia, J., Ennuitheism (2012) Science and the World's Religions: Vol 3.

This bias may be induced by the right hemisphere's dominance for emotional expression and agency. Since negative emotions are particularly portrayed by the left hemiface, and since asymmetrical hemispheric activation may induce alterations of spatial attention and action-intention, we posited that paintings of the painful and cruel crucifixion of Jesus would be more likely to show his left hemiface than observed in portraits of other people. By analyzing depictions of Jesus's crucifixion from book and art gallery sources, we determined a significantly greater percent of these crucifixion pictures showed the left hemiface of Jesus facing the viewer than found in other portraits. In addition to the facial expression and hemispatial attention-intention hypotheses, there are other biblical explanations that may account for this strong bias, and these alternatives will have to be explored in future research. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","Emotion; Facial expression; Jesus; Laterality; Portrait",,"Adolphs, R., Damasio, H., Tranel, D., Damasio, A.R., Cortical systems for the recognition of emotion in facial expressions (1996) Journal of Neuroscience, 16 (23), pp. 7678-7687; Aftanas, L.I., Reva, N.V., Savotina, L.N., Makhnev, V.P., Neurophysiological correlates of induced discrete emotions in humans: An individually oriented analysis (2006) Neuroscience and Behavioral Physiology, 36 (2), pp. 119-130; Ahern, G.L., Schomer, D.L., Kleefield, J., Blume, H., Cosgrove, G.R., Weintraub, S., Mesulam, M.M., Right hemisphere advantage for evaluating emotional facial expressions (1991) Cortex, 27 (2), pp. 193-202; Blonder, L.X., Bowers, D., Heilman, K.M., The role of the right hemisphere in emotional communication (1991) Brain, 114 (3), pp. 1115-1127; Blonder, L.X., Burns, A.F., Bowers, D., Moore, R.W., Heilman, K.M., Right hemisphere facial expressivity during natural conversation (1993) Brain and Cognition, 21 (1), pp. 44-56; Borod, J.C., Kent, J., Koff, E., Martin, C., Alpert, M., Facial asymmetry while posing positive and negative emotions: Support for the right hemisphere hypothesis (1988) Neuropsychologia, 26 (5), pp. 759-764; Borod, J.C., Koff, E., Lorch, M.P., Nicholas, M., Channels of emotional expression in patients with unilateral brain damage (1985) Archives of Neurology, 42 (4), pp. 345-348; Borod, J.C., Koff, E., Perlman Lorch, M., Nicholas, M., The expression and perception of facial emotion in brain-damaged patients (1986) Neuropsychologia, 24 (2), pp. 169-180; Bowers, D., Bauer, R.M., Coslett, H.B., Heilman, K.M., Processing of faces by patients with unilateral hemisphere lesions (1985) Brain and Cognition, 4, pp. 258-272; Buck, R., Duffy, R.J., Nonverbal communication of affect in brain-damaged patients (1980) Cortex, 16 (3), pp. 351-362; Chatterjee, A., Portrait profiles and the notion of agency (2002) Empirical Studies of the Arts, 20 (1), pp. 33-41; Chatterjee, A., Maher, L.M., Gonzalez Rothi, L.J., Heilman, K.M., Asyntactic thematic role assignment: The use of a temporal-spatial strategy (1995) Brain and Language, 49 (2), pp. 125-139; Conesa, J., Brunold-Conesa, C., Miron, M., Incidence of the half-left profile pose in singlesubject portraits (1995) Perceptual & Motor Skills, 81 (3 PART 1), pp. 920-922; Coslett, H.B., Schwartz, M.F., Goldberg, G., Haas, D., Perkins, J., Multi-modal hemispatial deficits after left hemisphere stroke.

However, if a propensity towards religious beliefs is a fundamental characteristic of human brains (as both by-product theorists and adaptationists agree), and/or an important ingredient of Darwinian fitness (as adaptationists argue), then how do we explain the existence and prevalence of atheists–even among ancient and traditional societies? The null hypothesis is that–like other psychological traits–due to natural variation among individuals in genetics, physiology, and cognition, there will always be a range of strengths of religious beliefs. Atheists may therefore simply represent one end of a natural distribution of belief. However, an evolutionary approach to religion raises some more interesting adaptive hypotheses for atheism, which I explore here. Key among them are: (1) frequency dependence may mean that atheism as a “strategy” is selected for (along with selection for the “strategy” of belief), as long as atheists do not become too numerous; (2) ecological variation may mean that atheism outperforms belief in certain settings or at certain times, maintaining a mix in the overall population; (3) the presence of atheists may reinforce or temper religious beliefs and behaviors in the face of skepticism, boosting religious commitment, credibility, or practicality in the group as a whole; and (4) the presence of atheists may catalyze the functional advantages of religion, analogous to the way that loners or non-participants can enhance the evolution of cooperation. Just as evolutionary theorists ask what religious beliefs are “for” in terms of functional benefits for Darwinian fitness, an evolutionary approach suggests we should also at least consider what atheists might be for. © 2012, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Adaptation; Atheism; Evolution; Non-belief; Religion",,"Alcorta, C.S., Sosis, R., Ritual, emotion, and sacred symbols: The evolution of religion as an adaptive complex (2005) Human Nature, 16, pp. 323-359; Alexander, R.D., (1987) The biology of moral systems, , Aldine, NY: Hawthorne; Atran, S., (2004) In gods we trust: The evolutionary landscape of religion, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Bainbridge, W.S., Atheism (2005) Interdisciplinary Journal of Research on Religion, 1. , Article 2; Barrett, J.L., Exploring the natural foundations of religion (2000) Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 4, pp. 29-34; Barrett, J.L., (2004) Why would anyone believe in God?, , New York: Altamira Press; Begon, M., Townsend, C.R., Harper, J.L., (2005) Ecology: From individuals to ecosystems, , Oxford: Blackwell Scientific; Beit-Hallahmi, B., Atheists: A psychological profile (2007) The Cambridge Companion to Atheism, pp. 300-317. , Martin M., (ed), Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Bering, J.M., The existential theory of mind (2002) Review of General Psychology, 6, pp. 3-24; Bering, J.M., The folk psychology of souls (2006) Behavioural and Brain Sciences, 29, pp. 453-462; Bering, J.M., (2010) The God instinct: The psychology of souls, destiny and the meaning of life, , London: Nicolas Brealey; Bering, J.M., Bjorklund, D.F., The natural emergence of reasoning about the afterlife as a developmental regularity (2004) Developmental Psychology, 40, pp. 217-233; Bering, J.M., Parker, B.D., Children's attributions of intentions to an invisible agent (2006) Developmental Psychology, 42, pp. 253-262; Blanke, O., Ortigue, S., Landis, T., Seeck, M., Stimulating illusory own-body perceptions (2002) Nature, 419, pp. 269-270; Bloom, P., (2004) Descartes’ baby: How the science of child development explains what makes us human, , New York: Basic Books; Boyer, P., (2001) Religion explained: The evolutionary origins of religious thought, , New York: Basic Books; Bremmer, J.N., Atheism in antiquity (2007) The Cambridge companion to atheism, pp. 11-26. , Martin M., (ed), Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Bulbulia, J., Religious costs as adaptations that signal altruistic intention (2004) Evolution and Cognition, 10, pp. 19-38; Bulbulia, J., Meme infection or religious niche construction?

Primordialist explanations are grounded in evolutionary psychology and emphasize the innate human demand for religion. Primordialists predict that religion does not decline in the modern era but will endure in perpetuity. Constructionist theories argue that religious demand is a human construct. Modernity initially energizes religion, but subsequently undermines it. Unpacking these ideal types is necessary in order to describe actual theorists of religion. Three distinctions within primordialism and constructionism are relevant: namely, those distinguishing (1) materialist from symbolist forms of constructionism; (2) theories of origins from those pertaining to the reproduction of religion; and (3) within reproduction, between theories of religious persistence and secularization. This typology helps to make sense of theories of religion by classifying them on the basis of their causal mechanisms, chronology, and effects. In so doing, it opens up new sightlines for theory and research. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.","Constructionism; Primordialism; Reproduction of religion; Secularization; Symbolism; Theories of nationalism; Theories of religion; Theory of religion",,"Alcorta, C.S., Sosis, R., Ritual, emotion, and sacred symbols: The evolution of religion as an adaptive complex (2005) Human Nature: An Interdisciplinary Biosocial Perspective, 16 (4), pp. 323-359; Anderson, B., (1983) Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism, , London: Verso; Anjum, O., Islam as a discursive tradition: Talal Asad and his interlocutors.

We conducted four experiments to better understand the cognitive processes that underlie memory for counterintuitive concepts by recording both reading time and recall of intuitive and counterintuitive statements. Experiments 1 and 2 suggested that additional time spent processing material facilitates memory performance, even if that material is intuitive. However, the results from Experiments 3 and 4 indicate that time alone does not account for the memory advantage previously observed.

The purpose of the current research was to provide an evolutionary framework for understanding the role of disgust in religiosity, which may help elucidate the relationship between religious conservatism and non-proscribed prejudice (e.g., prejudice toward sexual minorities). The behavioral immune system (BIS) is a cluster of psychological mechanisms (e.g., disgust) that encourage disease-avoidance (Schaller, 2006). Out-group members have historically been a source of contamination. Consequently, evidence suggests that the BIS predicts negative attitudes toward out-groups (Faulkner, Schaller, Park, & Duncan, 2004). The purpose of the current research is to investigate whether religious conservatism mediates the relationship between the BIS and prejudice toward sexual minorities. Study 1 demonstrated that the disease-avoidant components of disgust (e.g., sexual and pathogen disgust), but not moral disgust, were positively correlated with religious conservatism. Additionally, the data supported a model in which religious conservatism mediated the relationship between disgust and prejudice toward homosexuals. In Study 2, the correlations and mediation model were replicated with a more diverse sample and different measures. The current research suggests that religious conservatism may be in part an evolutionarily evoked disease-avoidance strategy. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.","Behavioral immune system; Disgust; Prejudice; Religious conservatism",,"Allen, R.O., Spilka, B., Committed and consensual religion: A specification of religion-prejudice relationships (1967) Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 6, pp. 191-206; Allport, G.W., Kramer, B.M., Some roots of prejudice (1946) Journal of Psychology: Interdisciplinary and Applied, 22, pp. 9-39; Allport, G.W., Ross, J.M., Personal religious orientation and prejudice (1967) Journal Ofpersonality and Social Psychology, 5, pp. 432-443; Altemeyer, B., Hunsberger, B., A revised religious fundamentalism scale: The short and sweet of it (2004) International Journal for the Psychology of Religion, 14, pp. 47-54; Anderson, J.C., Gerbing, G.W., Structural equation modeling in practice: A review and recommended two-step approach (1988) Psychological Bulletin, 103, pp. 411-423; Baron, R.M., Kenny, D.A., The moderator-mediator variable distinction in social psychological research: Conceptual, strategic and statistical considerations (1986) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 51, pp. 1173-1182; Batson, C.D., Schoenrade, P., Ventis, W.L., (1993) Religion and the Individual: A Social-Psychological Perspective, , New York: Oxford University Press; Burns, G., Keortge, S., Formea, G., Sternberger, L., Revision of the Padua Inventory of obsessive compulsive disorder symptoms: Distinctions between worry, obsessions, and compulsions.

Recent criticisms of this approach have suggested that this characterization of cognition is insufficient to account for the common presence of a third intuition humans have about other humans, namely that other people have souls or spirits (Hodge, 2008; Richert & Harris, 2008). We report on a study examining the nature of similarities and differences in the soul concept based on religious affiliation, and the implications of the soul concept for reasoning about beginning-of-life and end-of-life ethical dilemmas. Four hundred and nineteen undergraduate students completed a survey examining concepts of the soul, the mind, and reasoning about ethical dilemmas. The results suggest that adult soul concepts but not mind concepts are considered independent of the life cycle and are related to reasoning about ethical dilemmas independent of religious affiliation. These data lend empirical support to the hypothesis that the human tendency toward psychological essentialism provides a foundation for adults’ concepts of the soul. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.","Ethical reasoning; Soul",,"Astuti, R., Harris, P.L., Understanding mortality and the life of the ancestors in rural Madagascar (2008) Cognitive Science, 32, pp. 713-740; Bek, J., Lock, S., Afterlife beliefs: Category specificity and sensitivity to biological priming (2011) Religion, Brain, & Behavior, 1 (1), pp. 5-17; Bering, J.M., The folk psychology of souls (2006) Brain and Behavioral Sciences, 29, pp. 453-462; Bering, J.M., Bjorklund, D.F., The natural emergence of reasoning about the afterlife as a developmental regularity (2004) Developmental Psychology, 40, pp. 217-233; Bloom, P., (2004) Descartes’ Baby: How the Science of Child Development Explains What Makes Us Human, , New York: Basic Books; Chandler, M.J., The time of our lives: Self-continuity in native and non-native youth (2001) Advances in Child Development and Behavior, 28, pp. 175-221. , H.W Reese & R.

The theories we use to understand religion–and sociocultural systems more generally–are often so complex that even experts in the field may not be able to see all their consequences. Social simulations can help us understand and communicate the consequences of a theory, provided we can describe the theory with sufficient precision and comprehensiveness in order to run it on a computer. In this article we demonstrate the benefits of simulating the predictions of a well-known theory in the Cognitive Science of Religion, the theory of Divergent Modes of Religiosity. Many of these predictions have already been tested against contemporary and longitudinal evidence, using the methods of both qualitative case study and large-scale survey, and some of the mechanisms responsible for the patterns observed have been investigated by means of controlled experiments. Nevertheless, in simulating the patterns of religious transmission and transformation predicted by the modes theory we discovered numerous aspects that were underspecified, generating new hypotheses for investigation in future empirical research. This back-and-forth between simulation and theory testing has the potential to accelerate progress in the scientific study of religion. © 2012, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","ABM; Cargo cult; Computational modeling; Modes of religiosity; Religion; Ritual; Simulations; Socio-cultural evolution",,"Atkinson, Q.D., Whitehouse, H., The cultural morphospace of ritual form: Examining modes of religiosity cross-culturally (2011) Evolution and Human Behavior, 32 (1), pp. 50-62; Axelrod, R., Hamilton, W.D., The evolution of cooperation (1981) Science, 211, pp. 1390-1396; Barrett, J., (2004) Why would anyone believe in God?, , Walnut Creek, CA: AltaMira Press; Barrett, J., In the empirical mode: Evidence needed for the modes of religiosity theory (2005) Mind and religion: Psychological and cognitive foundations of religiosity, pp. 109-126. , Whitehouse H., McCauley R.N., (eds), Walnut Creek, CA: AltaMira Press; Bloom, P., (2004) Descartes’ baby: How the science of child development explains what makes us human, , New York: Basic Books; Boyer, P., (2001) Religion explained: The evolutionary origins of religious thought, , New York: Basic Books; Boyer, P., Lienard, P., Why ritualized behavior?

This raises the question: why do atheists exist and are atheism and non-belief unnatural? A diverse and growing literature on irreligion reveals that distinct personality and cognitive styles are associated with atheists and non-believers. They are slightly less social than religious believers, less conformist, and more individualistic. Atheists in particular are over-represented among scientists and academics, and their high intellectual achievement may stem in part from their preference for logic and their enjoyment of rational reasoning. Lacking interest in a reality beyond this world, non-believers focus their moral concerns on social justice and the here-and-now. This suggests that non-believers possess cognitive and personality strengths, in contrast to the negative assessments that have been historically the norm. This characterization provides a foundation for asking new research questions, such as whether these traits were adaptive during evolution, or whether they are artifacts of the current historical period, given that characteristics such as skepticism and nonconformity may facilitate rejecting the dominant cultural tradition. © 2012, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Atheism; Non-belief; Personality; Religiousness",,"Atran, S., (2002) In Gods we trust: The evolutionary landscape of religion, , New York: Oxford University Press; Axelrod, R., (1984) The evolution of cooperation, , New York: Basic Books; Bainbridge, W.S., Atheism (2005) Interdisciplinary Journal of Research on Religion, 1, pp. 1-25; Barrett, J., (2004) Why would anyone believe in God?, , Lanham, MD: Altamira; Beit-Hallahmi, B., Atheists: A psychological profile (2006) The Cambridge companion to atheism, pp. 300-318. , Martin M., (ed), New York: Cambridge University Press; Bering, J., (2010) The God instinct: The psychology of souls, destiny and the meaning of life, , London: Nicholas Brealey; Bering, J., Atheism is only skin deep: Geertz and Markusson rely mistakenly on sociodemographic data as meaningful indicators of underlying cognition (2010) Religion, 40, pp. 166-168; Boyd, R., Richerson, P., (1985) Culture and the evolutionary process, , Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press; Boyer, P., (2001) Religion explained: The evolutionary roots of religious thought, , New York: Basic Books; Byrne, R.W., Whiten, A., (1988) Machiavellian intelligence: Social expertise and the evolution of intellect in monkeys, apes, and humans, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Caldwell-Harris, C.L., LoTempio, E., Jordan, C., Ramanayake, N., (2008) Religious non-belief explained by intellectual orientation and childhood socialization, , 14–17 August, Boston, MA; Caldwell-Harris, C.L., Murphy, C.F., Velazquez, T., McNamara, P., (2011) Paper presented at the annual meeting of the Cognitive Science Society, , 20–23 July, Boston, MA; Caldwell-Harris, C.L., Wilson, A., LoTempio, E., Beit-Hallahmi, B., Exploring the atheist personality: Well-being, awe, and magical thinking in atheists, Buddhists, and Christians (2011) Mental Health, Religion & Culture, 14, pp. 659-672; Caplovitz, D., Sherrow, F., (1977) The religious drop-outs: Apostasy among college students, , Beverly Hills, CA: Sage Press; Colzato, L.S., van Beest, I., van den Wildenberg, W.P.M., Scorolli, C., Dorchin, S., Meiran, N., God: Do I have your attention?

One feature that has figured prominently in adaptationist accounts of religion is belief in the reality of moralizing, punishing supernatural agents. However, there is at present no unified theory of what fitness-relevant feature of the selective environment to which this cognitive predisposition is adapted. We distinguish two divergent and often conflated approaches to supernatural punishment theory which hypothesize the adaptive character of such beliefs arise from the fact that they increase cooperation or decrease the cost of incurring punishment for norm violations. We evaluate these, and group and individual selectionist versions, in view of game theoretic models, experimental studies, and ethnographic data in light of which each proposal is plausible but with which none is fully concordant. © 2000 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,"Cronk, L., Evolutionary theories of morality and the manipulative use of signals (1994) Zygon, 29 (1), pp. 81-101; Dickson, D.B., Olsen, J., Dahm, P.F., Wachtel, M.S., Where do you go when you die?

Evidence from evolutionary psychology suggests that commitment to supernatural agents facilitates prosocial behavior, and ecological studies have shown that costly rites can increase trust and cooperation. While there has been little systematic treatment of what the gods will know and care about, the contents of supernatural agents' minds seem to rest on a continuum between concerns of ritual behavior and concerns of interpersonal social behavior. In the Tyva Republic, many regions and resources are believed to possess protective “masters of the place” (cher eezi). Tyvans offer their appreciation for cher eezi at ritual cairns by offering food, prayer ties, and/or money. Survey and free-list data demonstrate that spirit-masters are neither omniscient nor concerned with morality, but are acutely concerned with ritual behavior and conservation practices. Moreover, their knowledge breadth is primarily limited to their domains of governance. Survey results nevertheless suggest that Tyvans show a tendency to attribute spirit-masters with knowledge of nearby moral behaviors even though these are not their readily listed concerns. © 2011 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Morality; Omniscience; Religious cognition; Ritual behavior; Supernatural agents; Tyva Republic",,"Abaev, N.V., (2010) The Northern Buddhism of Mahayana in Central Asia, , Kyzyl: Tuvan State University's Publishing House; Alcorta, C.S., Sosis, R., Ritual, emotion, and sacred symbols (2005) Human Nature, 16 (4), pp. 323-359; Arapchor, A.D., Orus-ool, C.M., (1995) Tyva Ulustung Mifteri bolgash Toolchurgu Chugaalary, , Kyzyl: Tyvanyng Nom Ündürer Cheri; Atran, S., Medin, D., Ross, N., Lynch, E., Vapnarsky, V., Ucan Ek’, E., Coley, J., Baran, M., Folkecology, cultural epidemiology, and the spirit of the commons: A garden experiment in the Maya lowlands, 1991–2001 (2002) Cultural Anthropology, 43 (3), pp. 421-450; Baron-Cohen, S., (1995) Mindblindness: An essay on autism and theory of mind, , Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press; Baron-Cohen, S., The extreme male brain theory of autism (2002) Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 6 (6), pp. 248-254; Baron-Cohen, S., (2003) The essential difference: Male and female brains and the truth about autism, , New York: Basic Books; Barrett, J.L., Cognitive constraints on Hindu concepts of the divine (1998) Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 37, pp. 608-619; Barrett, J.L., Smart gods, dumb gods, and the role of social cognition in structuring ritual intuitions (2002) Journal of Cognition and Culture, 2 (3), pp. 183-193; Barrett, J.L., (2004) Why would anyone believe in God?, , New York: AltaMira Press; Barrett, J.L., Keil, F.C., Conceptualizing a nonnatural entity: Anthropomorphism in God concepts (1996) Cognitive Psychology, 31, pp. 219-247; Barrett, J.L., Lawson, E.T., Ritual intuitions: Cognitive contributions to judgments of ritual efficacy (2001) Journal of Cognition and Culture, 1, pp. 183-201; Bawden, C.R., Two Mongol texts concerning Obo-worship (1958) Oriens Extremus, 5 (1), pp. 23-41; Bering, J.M., The existential theory of mind (2002) Review of General Psychology, 6 (1), pp. 3-24; Bering, J.M., Johnson, D.D.P., O Lord … you perceive my thoughts from afar”: Recursiveness and the evolution of supernatural agency (2005) Journal of Cognition and Culture, 5, pp. 118-142; Bering, J.M., McLeod, K.A., Shackelford, T.K., Reasoning about dead agents reveals possible adaptive trends (2005) Human Nature, 16, pp. 360-381; Birtalan, Á., Typology of stone cairn Obos (Preliminary report, based on Mongolian fieldwork material collected in 1991–1995) (1998) Tibetan mountain deities, their cults and representations, pp. 199-210. , Blondeau A., (ed), Vienna: Verlag der Österreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften; Boyer, P., Functional origins of religious concepts: Ontological and strategic selection in evolved minds (2000) The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute, 6, pp. 195-214; Boyer, P., (2001) Religion explained: The evolutionary origins of religious thought, , New York: Basic Books; Boyer, P., Why do gods and spirits matter at all?

Second, how can one come to love what one does not already love? Third, why is a deed considered not virtuous if consciously done for the sake of attaining virtue?

Although some religious practices are highly accessible and require no specialized expertise to engage in them, and others are part of highly controlled religious organizations that designate and legitimate religious experts, many are associated with loosely organized religious traditions that involve a variety of supernatural healing practices and remedies. How is expertise evaluated in these contexts? One possibility is that consensus information may be important; higher levels of agreement about the efficacy of an expert may be more convincing than lower levels of agreement. Another possibility is that the expertise of the informant may influence efficacy judgments. In cases in which the skeptic or supporter is another religious expert, does the expertise of the informant override consensus information? In the current study, we investigated the effect of consensus information and the expertise of informants on perceived efficacy evaluation of religious healers in Brazil, a cultural context in which religious healers are consulted to solve a great variety of everyday problems. Results indicate that although both consensus information and expertise independently influence the perceived efficacy of a religious healer, the opinion of another expert overrides consensus information when the two are in conflict. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Consensus; Expertise; Religious cognition; Supernatural reasoning; Testimony; Traditional healing",,"Asch, S.E., Studies of independence and conformity: A minority of one against a unanimous majority (1956) Psychological Monographs, p. 7; Ashforth, A., (2005) Witchcraft, Violence, and Democracy in South Africa, , Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press; Barrett, J., Lawson, T., Ritual intuitions: Cognitive contributions to judgments of ritual efficacy (2001) Journal of Cognition and Culture, 1, pp. 183-201; Barrett, J., Smart gods, dumb gods, and the role of social cognition in structuring ritual intuitions (2002) Journal of Cognition and Culture, 2, pp. 183-193; Boyer, P., (1994) The Naturalness of Religious Ideas: A Cognitive Theory of Religion, , Berkeley, CA: University of California Press; Boyer, P., Lienard, P., Ritual behavior in obsessive and normal individuals: Moderating anxiety and reorganizing the flow of behavior (2007) Current Directions in Psychological Science, 17, pp. 291-294; Chi, M.T.H., Feltovich, P.J., Glaser, R., Categorization and representation of physics problems by experts and novices (1981) Cognitive Science, 5, pp. 121-152; Cialdini, R.B., (1993) Influence: Science and Practice, , 3rd ed).

This problem can be resolved if free-riders are punished, but punishment is itself a public good subject to free-riding. The fear of supernatural punishment hypothesis (FSPH) proposes that belief in supernatural punishment might offer a solution to this problem by deflecting the cost of punishment onto supernatural forces and thereby incentivizing cooperation. FSPH is supported empirically by ethnographic data, but this work has so far focused on (1) institutional cooperative traits which may not reflect individual choices on how to behave in everyday social interactions and (2) threat of punishment from all-powerful moralizing high gods rather than other agents capable of supernatural punishment. Here, we consider the FSPH using variables which are linked to individual interaction and expand the number of variables measuring belief in different forms of supernatural punishment. Our findings do not fit these more general FSPH predictions. We suggest there may be something special about the link between moralizing high gods and institutional enforcement of cooperation that is not captured by these other variables. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Cooperation; Prosociality; Religion; SCCS; Supernatural beliefs; Supernatural punishment",,"Alcorta, C.S., Sosis, R., Ritual, emotion, and sacred symbols: The evolution of religion as an adaptive complex (2005) Human Nature, 16, pp. 323-359; Alexander, R., (1987) The Biology of Moral Systems, , New York, NY: Aldine de Gruyter; Atkinson, Q.D., Bourrat, P., Beliefs about God, the afterlife and morality support the role of supernatural policing in human cooperation (2011) Evolution and Human Behavior, 32, pp. 41-49; Atran, S., (2002) In Gods We Trust: The Evolutionary Landscape Ofreligion, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Barrett, J.L., Exploring the natural foundations of religion (2000) Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 4, pp. 29-34; Barrett, J.L., (2004) Why Would Anyone Believe in God?, , Walnut Creek, CA: AltaMira Press; Bering, J.M., The existential theory of mind (2002) Review of General Psychology, 6, pp. 3-24; Blackmore, S.J., (1999) The Meme Machine, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Bowie, F., Anthropology of religion (2008) Religion Compass, 2, pp. 862-874; Boyer, P., (2001) Religion Explained: The Human Instincts that Fashion Gods, Spirits and Ancestors, , London: Basic Books; Dawkins, R., (1976) The Selfish Gene, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Dennett, D.C., (2006) Breaking the Spell, , New York, NY: Penguin Books; Dunbar, R.I.M., Culture, honesty and the freerider problem (1999) The Evolution of Culture, pp. 194-213. , R.I.M.

This study used structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to examine the association between religious or spiritual factors and volume of the OFC. Change in the volume of participants’ left and right OFC was measured longitudinally over a period of 2_8 years. Multiple linear regression analyses showed that religious or spiritual factors were related to extent of atrophy in the left OFC. Significantly less atrophy of the left OFC was observed in participants who reported a life-changing religious or spiritual experience during the course of the study, and in members of Protestant religious groups who reported being born-again when entering the study. Significantly greater atrophy of the left OFC was also associated with more frequent participation in public religious worship. No significant relationship was observed between religious or spiritual factors and extent of atrophy in the right OFC. These results support the presence of a long-term relationship between religious or spiritual experience and brain structure, which may have clinical implications. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Older adults; Orbitofrontal cortex; Regional brain atrophy; Religion; Spirituality",,"(1994) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, , 4th ed.).

Although varying in emphasis, most theories point toward several specific behavioral features that distinguish ritual from instrumental behavior. Specifically, we have chosen to focus on the derivedness from instrumental behavior, intentional underspecification and goal-demotion. In contrast to instrumental or functional behavior (i.e., actions that cohere causally and have a necessary integration of subparts), we propose to view ritual and ritualized action as sub-categories of non-functional behavior (i.e., actions lacking causal coherence and a necessary integration between subparts). New insights in human action processing can help us explain how cognition might vary depending on the type of behavior processed. Using an event segmentation paradigm, we conducted two experiments eliciting differences in participants’ response patterns to functional and non-functional actions. Participants consistently segmented non-functional action sequences into smaller units indicating either an attentional shift to the level of gesture analysis or a problem of representational integration. Experimental studies of non-functional behavior can strengthen explanations of recurrent features of human action processing, such as ritual and ritualized behavior, as well as indicate potential sources and effects of breakdown of the system. © 2011 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Event segmentation; Goal-demotion; Non-functional behavior; Ritual; Ritualized behavior",,"Alcorta, C.S., Sosis, R., Ritual, emotion, and sacred symbols (2005) Human Nature, 16 (4), pp. 323-359; Baldwin, D.A., Baird, J.A., Saylor, M.M., Clark, M.A., Infants parse dynamic action (2001) Child Development, 72 (3), pp. 708-717; Bloch, M., Symbols, song, dance and features of articulation.

Glossolalia is a form of dissociation considered by Pentecostals as possession by the Holy Spirit. Dissociation is a psychological term for partitioning of awareness and widely held to moderate stress, yet this has been difficult to affirm in culturally embedded situations. We sought to determine if glossolalic dissociation is associated with biomarkers of stress and arousal (salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase, respectively) on a religious service and a non-service day among 52 participants. We used mixed qualitative and quantitative methods to group participants as high- and low-glossolalists for preliminary comparisons and by status within their respective churches for regression analyses. Results indicate a significant influence of two glossolalia indicators on cortisol and alpha-amylase on both days, in addition to a statistically significant though not robust interaction effect between lifetime glossolalia experience and church status on the non-service day. Combined, these data suggest glossolalia experience is associated with increased physiological stress during worship and reduced stress and arousal beyond the worship context. © 2011 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Alpha-amylase; Biomarkers; Cortisol; Dissociation; Glossolalia; Pentecostalism; Stress",,"Adam, E.K., Hawkley, L.C., Kudielka, B.M., Cacioppo, J.T., Day-to-day dynamics of experience–cortisol associations in a population-based sample of older adults (2006) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 103 (45), pp. 17058-17063; Adam, E.K., Kumari, M., Assessing salivary cortisol in large-scale, epidemiological research (2009) Psychoneuroendocrinology, 34, pp. 1423-1436; Benson, H., Klipper, M.Z., (2000) The relaxation response, , New York: HarperCollins; Benson, P.L., Donahue, M.J., Erickson, J.A., The Faith Maturity Scale: Conceptualization, measurement, and empirical validation (1993) Research in the social scientific study of religion, pp. 1-26. , Lynn M.L., Moberg D.O., (eds), Greenwich, CT: JAI Press; Blake, R.L., McKay, D.A., A single-item measure of social support as a predictor of morbidity (1986) Journal of Family Practice, 22 (1), pp. 82-84; Bosch, J.A., Veerman, E.C.I., de Geus, E.J., Proctor, G.B., Amylase as a reliable and convenient measure of sympathetic activity: Don't start salivating just yet!

One feature that has figured prominently in adaptationist accounts of religion is belief in the reality of moralizing, punishing supernatural agents. However, there is at present no unified theory of what fitness-relevant feature of the selective environment to which this cognitive predisposition is adapted. We distinguish two divergent and often conflated approaches to supernatural punishment theory which hypothesize the adaptive character of such beliefs arise from the fact that they increase cooperation or decrease the cost of incurring punishment for norm violations. We evaluate these, and group and individual selectionist versions, in view of game theoretic models, experimental studies, and ethnographic data in light of which each proposal is plausible but with which none is fully concordant. © 2011 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Afterlife beliefs; Cheater punishment; Cognitive science of religion; Error management theory; Evolution of religion; Human cooperation; Moralizing gods; Supernatural punishment",,"Alexander, R., (1987) The biology of moral systems, , Piscataway, NJ: Aldine Transaction; Astuti, R., Whitehouse, H., Laidlaw, J., Ancestors and the afterlife (2007) Religion, anthropology, and cognitive science, pp. 161-178. , Durham, NC, Carolina Academic Press; Atran, S., (2002) In gods we trust: The evolutionary landscape of religion, , New York: Oxford University Press; Barkow, J., Cosmides, L., Tooby, J., (1992) The adapted mind: Evolutionary psychology and the generation of culture, , New York: Oxford University Press; Barrett, J., (2004) Why would anyone believe in God?, , Walnut Creek, CA: AltaMira Press; Bateson, M., Nettle, D., Roberts, G., Cues of being watched enhance cooperation in real-world setting (2006) Biology Letters, 22, pp. 412-414; Bering, J.M., The evolutionary history of an illusion: Religious causal beliefs in children and adults (2005) Origins of the social mind: Evolutionary psychology and child development, pp. 411-437. , Ellis B., Bjorklund D.F., (eds), New York: Guilford Press; Bering, J.M., Johnson, D.D.P., O Lord … you perceive my thoughts from afar’: Recursiveness and the evolution of supernatural agency (2005) Journal of Cognition and Culture, 5, pp. 118-142; Bering, J.M., Blasi, C.H., Bjorklund, D.F., The development of ‘afterlife’ beliefs in religiously and secularly schooled children (2005) British Journal of Developmental Psychology, 23, pp. 587-607; Bloom, P., (2005) Is God an accident?, , Boston, MA: Atlantic Monthly; Boehm, C., (1999) Hierarchy in the forest: The evolution of egalitarian behavior, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Boehm, C., The natural selection of altruistic traits (1999) Human Nature, 10, pp. 205-252; Boehm, C., A biocultural evolutionary exploration of supernatural sanctioning (2008) Evolution of religion: Studies, theories, and critiques, pp. 143-152. , Bulbulia J., Sosis R., Harris E., Genet R., Genet C., Wyman K., (eds), Santa Margarita, CA: Collins Foundation Press; Botelho, A., Harrison, G.W., Pinto, L.M.C., Rutström, E.E., Social norms and social choice.

This category-specific pattern has been interpreted in terms of simulation constraints, whereby it may be harder to imagine the absence of some states than others. Afterlife beliefs have also shown context-sensitivity, suggesting that environmental exposure to different types of information might influence adults’ reasoning about post-death states. We sought to clarify category and context effects in adults’ afterlife reasoning. Participants read a story describing the death of a human protagonist after exposure to a biological prime, an emotional prime, or no prime. Emotions, desires, and epistemic states were more frequently attributed to the dead character than biological, psychobiological, and perceptual states, partially replicating previous findings. The biological prime decreased the attribution of certain post-death states relative to the control condition, whereas the emotional prime had no effect. Simulation theory does not provide a satisfactory explanation of the present findings, which may be better accounted for by conflict between different cognitive systems that are engaged in thinking about the dead. © 2011 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Afterlife; Cognitive science of religion; Death; Dualism; Simulation constraint hypothesis",,"Antony, M.V., Simulation constraints, afterlife beliefs, and common-sense dualism (2006) Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 29, pp. 462-463; Astuti, R., Harris, P.L., Understanding mortality and the life of the ancestors in rural Madagascar (2008) Cognitive Science, 32, pp. 713-740; Barrett, J.L., Exploring the natural foundations of religion (2000) Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 4, pp. 29-35; Barrett, J.L., (2004) Why would anyone believe in God?, , Walnut Creek, CA: AltaMira Press; Bering, J.M., Intuitive conceptions of dead agents’ minds: The natural foundations of afterlife beliefs as phenomenological boundary (2002) Journal of Cognition and Culture, 2, pp. 263-308; Bering, J.M., The folk psychology of souls (2006) Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 29, pp. 453-498; Bering, J.M., Bjorklund, D.F., The natural emergence of reasoning about the afterlife as a developmental regularity (2004) Developmental Psychology, 40, pp. 217-233; Bloom, P., (2004) Descartes’ baby: How the science of child development explains what makes us human, , New York: Basic Books; Bloom, P., Religion is natural (2007) Developmental Science, 10, pp. 147-151; Boyer, P., (2001) Religion explained, , London: Vintage; Bullot, N.J., The principle of ontological commitment in pre- and postmortem multiple agent tracking (2006) Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 29, pp. 466-468; Cohen, E., Burdett, E., Knight, N. & Barrett, J.

We suggest that these benefits might be explained, at least in part, from a “motivated meaning-making” perspective. This model holds that people are motivated to create and sustain meaning (i.e., a sense of coherency between beliefs, goals, and perceptions of the environment, which provides individuals with the feeling that the world is an orderly place), and that religious beliefs buffer the distress associated with disruptions to meaning, thus leading to decreases in distress. We further propose that religion's palliative attributes can be measured at the level of the brain, specifically in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), which produces a “distress signal” upon the detection of errors, conflict, and expectancy violation. Using a social neuroscience paradigm, we investigate four main predictions that arise from this model: (1) religion should be associated with activation in the ACC; (2) religion should decrease activation in the ACC; (3) this attenuation of ACC activity should be related to religion's ability to buffer bodily states of distress, and not to decreases in motivation, attention, or control; (4) religion should have these effects because it provides meaning and thus buffers people from uncertainty. All predictions were supported, thus providing evidence, at the neural level, for the motivated meaning-making model's account of the salutary properties of religion. © 2011 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Anterior cingulate cortex;
