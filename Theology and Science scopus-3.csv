It engages with Pyror's argument, critiquing his view of planetarity as too large. Planetarity is also too small to be limited to a planet, because a planet or a moon that can sustain life, at least life as currently understood, requires an energy source, in this case of Earth, the sun. This means that the planet is intra-acting with the sun in terms of defining habitability. Turning to Pryor's discussion of Imago Dei, I argue that his understanding of refracting the creative power of divine requires humans to move from nonmaleficence to beneficence in terms of human obligations to the development of life in the universe. © 2022 Graduate Theological Union (CTNS Program).","astrobiology; astrotheology; human evolution; Imago Dei; Planetarity",,,"Molhoek, B.; Graduate Theological UnionUnited States",,"Routledge",14746700,,,,"English","Theology Sci.",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85131757175

But this shift seems far more easy than it really is. Second, Peters’ list of alternative models for the divine do not fit, hermeneutically speaking, biblical language.

This manifesto therefore proposes a way out of this dire epistemological and ethical bind. To restore Islamic Magic to its rightful place in Western intellectual and cultural history, especially history of science, we must take far more seriously the panpsychist cosmology on which it is predicated, and realize that our own reflexive materialism commits us willynilly to a colonialist agenda that is, ironically, both antireligious and antiscientific. © 2020, © 2020 Graduate Theological Union (CTNS Program).","colonialism; eurocentrism; experimentalism; materialism; mathesis; Occultism; panpsychism; psychophysics; religionism; science and empire studies; scientism",,,"Melvin-Koushki, M.",,"Routledge",14746700,,,,"English","Theology Sci.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084812365

Since Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay have differences in religiosity, teachers from these countries were asked to answer to the question of the European questionnaire BIOHEAD-CITIZEN: “The emergence of the human species (Homo sapiens) was just as improbable as the emergence of any other species."" From their answers, it was possible to estimate how biology teachers conceive the origin of the humankind, whether they perceive it as a natural phenomenon or a special event. The four Barbour’s categories concerning the relationship between science and religion (Conflict, Independence, Dialogue and Integration) were used to analyze the results in these three countries. Results showed that, in general, teachers of Uruguay (a secular country) and Argentina (a constitutional Catholic country) had a clearer position of separation between science and religion whereas the teachers of Brazil (with a relative secularism), tended to do not make a separation between science and religion. It could be concluded that the type of the teachers’ religion rather than the secularism of state is more influencial on building teachers’ views about human origin. © 2019 Graduate Theological Union (CTNS Program).","Human evolution; Laicism; Religion; Science; Teachers",,"Barbour, I.G., (1990) Religion in an Age of Science, , Harper & Row, San Francisco; Berger, D., Bernard, S., Wafo, F., Hrairi, S., Balcou, M., Carvalho, G.S., Éducation à La Santé et à La Sexualité: Qu’en Pensent Les Enseignants?

Robert John Russell’s “fall without a fall"" provides greater coherence in the proleptic version of Theistic Evolution. © 2019 Graduate Theological Union (CTNS Program).","Bethany Sollereder; Charles Darwin; Christopher Southgate; Eschatology; Evolution; God; Proleptic theistic evolution; Redemption; Robert John Russell; Suffering; Theodicy",,,,,"Routledge",14746700,,,,"English","Theology Sci.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063491316

The first half is a response to the theology of glory in Southgate’s Theology in a Suffering World (CUP 2018). The second half expands on Southgate’s work on practical theodicy. I argue for a redirection of the work of theodicy toward a compassionate approach, outlined by three principles that are centred around helping those who suffer create their own theodicies. The job of the practical and compassionate theodicist, then, is not to provide answers for why suffering occurs, but rather to offer resources to help others frame their own experience. © 2019 Graduate Theological Union (CTNS Program).","Christopher Southgate; Compassionate theodicy; Glory; Trauma",,,"Sollereder, B.N.; Oxford UniversityUnited Kingdom",,"Routledge",14746700,,,,"English","Theology Sci.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063490775

As a way of working some of the ethical problems associated with METI, I approach the sending of a message from the perspective that it represents a research endeavor involving sentient beings and therefore, should undergo review by a university institutional review board (IRB). As such, METI should be expected to meet several criteria expected by IRBs as being necessary components of ethically justifiable research. By considering issues of proportionality, justice, informed consent, the likely success of obtaining desired results, and necessity and considering risks and benefits to research subjects, as well as the mandate to do no harm, it is evident that METI does not meet the requirements for ethical research on human subjects and, thus, should not be considered ethical when it comes to nonhuman sentient beings. © 2018 Graduate Theological Union (CTNS Program).","Active SETI; Informed consent; IRB; Justice; Research ethics",,"Childress, J.F., (1981) Priorities in Biomedical Ethics, pp. 55-57. , Philadelphia: The Westminster Press; Traphagan, J.W., (2013) Rethinking Autonomy: A Critique of Principlism in Biomedical Ethics, , Albany: State University of New York Press; Edwards, S.J., Omar, R., Ethics Review of Research: In Pursuit of Proportionality (2008) Journal of Medical Ethics, 34 (7), p. 568; What is Human Subjects Research?, , https://research.utexas.edu/ors/humansubjects/what-is-human-subjects-research/, Anonymous n. d; (2017), https://www.seti.org/seti-institute/project/details/broadcasting-message; Michaud, M.A.G., Ten Decisions that Could Shake the World (2003) Space Policy, 19 (2); Asaro, P.M., A Body to Kick, but Still No Soul to Damn: Legal Perspectives on Robotics (2012) Robot Ethics: The Ethical and Social Implications of Robotics, p. 180. , eds.

Then this article makes two claims: (1) the existence or non-existence of extraterrestrials is not a threat to the Indian mind as the Indian worldview provides sufficient tools to accommodate extraterrestrials; plus (2) Roman Catholic moral theology should reframe its ethical thinking with an inclusive cosmic paradigm to embrace the extraterrestrials. © 2018 Graduate Theological Union (CTNS Program).","Advaita; Cosmic worldview; Dharma; Ethics; Exoplanet; Extraterrestrials; Punarjanma",,"(2016) Stephen Hawking’s Favourite Places, , https://curiositystream.com/video/1697, accessed July 25, 2018; Vakoch, D.A., Hawking’s Fear of an Alien Invasion May Explain the Fermi Paradox (2017) Theology and Science, 152, pp. 134-138 and 138. , May; Kumar, S., India’s Surprise Plan to Send People to Space by 2022 (2018) Nature, 561, pp. 160 and 7722. , 13 September; Narlikar, J.V., Lloyd, D., Wainwright, M., Rajratnam, P., Shivaji, S., Reddy, G.S.N., Ramadurai, S., Hoyle, F., A Balloon Experiment to Detect Microorganisms in the Outer Space (2003) Astrophysics and Space Science, 285, pp. 555-562; Louis, G., Santhosh Kumar, A., Growth Characteristics of Red Rain Microbes at Temperatures Below 100°C (2010) Proceedings of the SPIE: Instruments, Methods, and Missions for Astrobiology XIII, , eds.

Further, sending pinpointed, collimated messages will only lead to positive outcomes.

In this article, I examine the basic logic of BDA by comparing it with Pascal’s Wager.

This article challenges this first impression. Within the science and theology dialogue, panpsychism has been a central component of Process theologians’ efforts to integrate these disciplines into a larger metaphysical framework; but, this is not the method adopted in this paper. Instead, it is argued that panpsychism gives scholars the potential for greater progress in two field defining discussions: quantum accounts of special divine action and theistic evolution. It is shown that panpsychism currently finds sufficient consonance with the relevant scientific disciplines and has substantial benefits for theologians engaged in these areas. Panpsychism holds great promise as the philosophy of mind for future generations of science-and-religion scholars. © 2018 Graduate Theological Union (CTNS Program).","Evolutionary biology; Panpsychism; Philosophy of mind; Quantum mechanics; Special divine action; Theistic evolution",,"Clayton, P., (2004) Mind and Emergence: From Quantum to Consciousness, p. 130. , New York: Oxford University Press; Seager, W., (2017) Routledge Companion to Panpsychism, , New York: Routledge; Brüntrop, G., Jaskolla, L., (2017) Panpsychism: Contemporary Perspectives, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Skrbina, D., (2017) Panpsychism in the West, , 2nd ed, Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Goff, P., (2017) Consciousness and Fundamental Reality, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Goff, P., Seager, W., Allen-Hermanson, S., Panpsychism (2017) The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, , https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2017/entries/panpsychism/, Winter, ed, ed.

The former is focused on proximate causes, the latter is looking for ultimate causes of religious beliefs and behaviours. Both approaches are useful and promising. However, in both cases, various important aspects and contexts associated with the origin, acquisition, and transmission of religious beliefs have been neglected. The present paper offers an approach that conjoins both models after reviewing several critical issues, to highlight a distinction between cognitive conditions and structures, on one side; and developments or applications, on the other. As a result greater attention needs to be paid to religious functions and their cultural framework to better understand religion and to explain some current processes, like massive secularization in several areas. © 2018 Graduate Theological Union (CTNS Program).","Cognitive science of religion; Evolutionary study of religion; Proximate explanation; Social function; Ultimate explanation",,"Barrett, J.L., (2004) Why Would Anyone Believe in God?

The diversity of these worlds exceeds scientific expectations and rivals foreshadowing by the most creative science fiction writers. Extrapolations based on statistical arguments and our understanding of how planetary systems form suggest exoplanets may outnumber the roughly 10 million quadrillion stars in the observable Universe. There are compelling reasons to expect conditions conducive to life on many of these worlds, but the existence of extraterrestrial life remains an open question.

Could genetic engineering help? Moral enhancement through genetic engineering might predispose us to performing good acts, good deeds. However, good acts alone, theologically speaking, do not count as either morality or holiness. Becoming a good and holy person-in-community is a process of freely chosen character development. While re-creating ourselves genetically to eliminate aggressive acts is not insignificant, such interventions constitute a starting point, not the endpoint, of living a meaningful life in relation to God. Bernard Lonergan’s notion of moral agency requires moral conversion and religious conversion, neither of which could be achieved through gene expression alone. Conversion requires free and intentional participation in moral character development. Finally, we note that salvation according to Christianity is not earned, regardless of a person’s good acts or good moral character. © 2018 Graduate Theological Union (CTNS Program).","Bernard Lonergan; Community; Genetic engineering; Intentionality; Mark Miller; Moral agency; Moral conversion; Moral responsibility; Religious conversion; Virtue",,"Juengst, E., Moseley, D., (2016) Human Enhancement, , https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spring2016/entries/enhancement/, The Stanford Encyclopedia of PhilosophySpring, Editiond.

After exposing the Achilles heel of the traditional free-will defense, Walker develops the Irenaean and Augustinian responses to the anthropic problem. Most importantly for this discussion, Walker proceeds to propose Genetic-First-Enhancement as part of his neo-Irenaean theodicy formulation. Overall, there are two major concerns I raised: the impossibility of a gradient morality in the presence of free will, and the scientific impossibility of Genetic Virtue Program. However, my claims are falsifiable if future genetic modifications do indeed improve morality.

After reviewing current scientific knowledge gained from genetic engineering, it is difficult to answer affirmatively. Because virtuous living is complex and difficult to define, it makes searching for relevant genes difficult. To date, such genes do not appear in the geneticist’s inventory. An additional unknown is the role of free will. Even more important, theologically, is the role of God in leading to our sanctification.

(4) Should there be a distinction between somatic and germline gene modification? (5) Is genetic modification best approach to moral enhancement?

The traditional Irenaean theodicy emphasizes the importance of education for soul building. Soul building can benefit from technologically enhancing the biological superstructure of our humanity. In particular, genetic engineering can enhance human virtue. The biological basis of our moral natures can be improved using genetic technologies, including (possibly) somatic and germline engineering.

Next, I use Lakatos’ philosophy of science to distinguish between ad hoc and well-motivated exegetical moves. Based upon these criteria, I then present the gap- and day-age theories as examples of hermeneutical failure in the accommodation of science.

This author argues that since social neuroscience and theology are both non-reductionist, they can contribute to a balanced view of human nature and nurture. Social neuroscientific research has shown the ways in which social factors impact the brain’s development, and also how social factors are necessary for the treatment of diseases. Social neuroscience can thus enrich essential teachings and practice of religions, such as sociality and healing. Finally, this article examines how social neuroscience can be used in a reinterpretation of Wesleyan soteriology. © 2018 Graduate Theological Union (CTNS Program).","Neuroscience; Non-reductionism; Social neuroscience; Sociality; Theology and science; Theology of nature; Wesleyan soteriology",,"Stone, L.G., The Soul: Possession, Part, or Person?

Using Cyprian’s writings, we see the foundation of much of Christian behavior in regard to inclusion in a Christian community and the theology of penance. The broader issue of inclusivity and forgiveness connects to what evolutionary science presents on the issue regarding guilt and shame, and recent psychological work on achieving reconciliation and forgiveness between persons or in a community. By placing the Christian tradition into dialogue with these modern scientific studies, we find that a fruitful dialogue is possible which enriches both the religious and scientific communities. © 2018 Graduate Theological Union (CTNS Program).","Cyprian of Carthage; Emotion; Forgiveness; Guilt; Penance; Reconciliation",,"Brent, A., (2006) On the Church: Select Treatises, p. 11. , St. Cyprian of Carthage, trans. and commentary by Allen Brent, Popular Patristics Series 32 (Crestwood, NY: St Vladimir’s Seminary Press; Decret, F., (2009) Early Christianity in North Africa, p. 70. , trans.

This is misleading. Science and religion interact at so many different junctures and in so many different ways that any simple generalization misguides us. This essay provides an updated inventory of ten popular conceptual models for relating science and theology, when theology is understood as rational reflection on religion. Four influential models assume that a war is taking place: (1) scientism; (2) scientific imperialism; (3) theological authoritarianism; and (4) the evolution controversy. Six additional preferred models assume a truce or even more, a partnership: (5) the Two Books; (6) the Two Languages; (7) ethical alliance; (8) dialogue accompanied by creative mutual interaction; (9) naturalism; and (10) theology of nature. Special attention will be given to creative mutual interaction within a framework of a theology of nature. © 2017 Graduate Theological Union (CTNS Program).","Religion; Science; Theology",,"Re Manning, R., Introduction (2012) Science and Religion in the Twenty-First Century: The Boyle Lectures at St. Mary-Le-Bow, , eds.

Russell’s 2017 Boyle Lecture moves in the ‘opposite’ direction, showing how theological convictions held, often implicitly, by research scientists can play a creative role in both the construction of scientific theories and the choice between existing theories. As examples, Russell explores the conflicts over Big Bang versus Steady-State cosmologies, and between Einstein and Bohr about quantum mechanics. Against the claim that these influences die off once the conflict is over, Russell shows that they continue to be inherited by successive generations of scientists. © 2017 Graduate Theological Union (CTNS Program).","Creative mutual interaction Einstein; Hoyle; Natural theology; Natural theology ‘in reverse’; Theological and philosophical influences in science",,"Russell, R.J., (2012) Cosmology from Alpha to Omega: The Creative Mutual Interaction of Theology and Science, , (Fortress Press, 2008).

Besides showing itself to be a fruitful conceptualization of both “the miraculous” and the natural world, this paper argues that Murphy’s insights can be extended to address a pressing question in contemporary political theology: the nature and function of power in increasingly pluralistic societies. The upshot, drawing on the connection between conceptualizations of miracle and sovereignty made by Carl Schmitt, is that Murphy’s non-interventionist theory of divine action at the quantum level “fits” with an equally noninterventionist account of political authority from below, at the level of an active, democratically engaged citizenry. © 2017 Graduate Theological Union (CTNS Program).","Divine action; Miracle; Nancey Murphy; Political theology; Radical democracy; Sovereignty",,"Murphy, N., Ellis, G.F.R., (1996) On the Moral Nature of the Universe: Theology, Cosmology, and Ethics, , Minneapolis, MN: Fortress; John, R., Russell’s Essay in the Present Volume: “The Crucial Importance of Nancey Murphy’s Deployment of Lakatos’ Methodology for Theology and Science; Strong, T.B., (1996) Foreword, p. 13. , in Carl Schmitt, The Concept of the Political, trans.

Embodied cognition understands all human thought as involving the body (not just the brain), and as always situated in particular contexts. Cognitive extension goes further to suggest that intelligent mental processes often include things outside the brain and body, involving interactions with other persons or external artifacts that significantly enhance cognitive capacities. Thus, while intelligence was once thought to be an attribute of a single individual’s brain, it is now understood to extend into processes outside the person within immediate interactive space. For example, smart phones or problem-solving groups expand cognitive capacities beyond what is possible on one’s own.

Beginning with theological anthropology, the article shows that cultural evolution problematizes purely substantive accounts of the image of God. Moving to the doctrine of sin, we explain how cultural evolutionary findings enrich and challenge distinct aspects of hamartiology. The article turns to moral topics, since cultural evolution sheds light on altruistic and hyper-social behavior; additionally, we show how belief in moral deities and observation of religious rituals provide an evolutionary advantage. Finally, the authors analyze whether cultural evolution amounts to an explanation of religion. © 2017 Graduate Theological Union (CTNS Program).","Altruism; Cultural evolution; Hamartiology; Morality; Ritual; Theological anthropology",,"Darwin, C., (1872) On the Origin of Species: By Means of Natural Selection, p. 146. , 6th ed.

Or, is there more? If nature is the only reality, is it ultimate or sacred? Differing answers to these questions determine the different brands of naturalism on the religious shelf. What virtually all of today’s naturalists agree on is this: science provides the means for revealing reality, the sole reality which is material, physical, and cosmic. Naturalists also agree that supranaturalism should be rejected. What naturalists differ on whether nature is divine or not. This article sorts out the issues and differing positions taken on each issue. The author contends that a post-Newtonian worldview remains open to a concept of God wherein divine action in nature’s world influences creativity and transformation. © 2017 Graduate Theological Union (CTNS Program).","biblicism; fideism; natural theology; Nature; religious naturalism; scientific naturalism; theology of nature",,"Schwarz, H., (2014) Vying for Truth--Theology and the Natural Sciences, p. 11. , Göttingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht; https://religiousnaturalism.org/, (accessed 4/8/2017); Carroll, S., (2016) The Big Picture: On the Origins of Life, Meaning, and the Universe Itself, p. 11. , New York: Dutton; Carroll, S., (2016) The Big Picture: On the Origins of Life, Meaning, and the Universe Itself, p. 431. , New York: Dutton; Kurtz, P., (1984) Transcendental Temptation: A Critique of Religion and the Paranormal, p. 56. , Buffalo NY: Prometheus Books; Rue, L., (2006) Religion is Not about God, p. 366. , New Brunswick NJ: Rutgers University Press; Drees, W.B., Science, Values and Loves: Theologies as Expressive Constructions (2017) Theology and Science, 15, pp. 249-259; Cavanaugh, M., What is Religious Naturalism?

The sciences are important, as we need not only individual authenticity but also accountability. My position presented here is science-inspired naturalistic theism. It is not “religious naturalism”, given the categorical difference between facts and values. It is not “natural theology”, as inductive approaches do not reach that far.

In the tradition of Thomas Aquinas, the truths of natural reason are discovered by using the natural light of reason, that is, the capacity for intelligent thought that all human beings have by virtue of being human. Similarly, the truths beyond reason are outside the aptitude of the natural light of reason to discover or verify. They are available only through faith. What Teilhard teaches us is that the Book of Nature can no longer be separated from the Book of Scripture without denying God.

In particular, Josiah Royce’s Loyalty-to-Loyalty initiates a moral stance within which humans and intelligent agents can develop constructive ethical frameworks and his semiotic philosophy of community can guide the development and functioning of an agent’s interpretive processes and can model shared spiritual formation. © 2017 Graduate Theological Union (CTNS Program).","Artificial intelligence; Charles Sanders Peirce; Josiah Royce; machine ethics; moral theology; semiotics; spiritual formation",,"Müller, V.C., Bostrom, N., Future Progress in Artificial Intelligence: A Survey of Expert Opinion (2014) Fundamental Issues of Artificial Intelligence; Hall, J.S., Self-Improving AI: An Analysis (2007) Minds and Machines, 17 (3), pp. 249-259; Kurzweil, R., (2005) The Singularity is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology, , New York: Viking; Goertzel, B., Artificial General Intelligence: Concept, State of the Art, and Future Prospects (2014) Journal of Artificial General Intelligence, 5 (1), pp. 1-48; Alpert, J., Hajaj, N., We Knew the Web Was Big (2008) Official Google Blog, , http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/07/we-knew-web-was-big.html, July 25, May 30, 2015; Anderson, M., Anderson, S.L., Machine Ethics: Creating An Ethical Intelligent Agent (2007) AI Magazine, 28 (4); Anderson, M., Anderson, S.L., (2011) Machine Ethics, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Storrs Hall, J., Beyond, A.I., (2007) Creating the Conscience of the Machine, , Amherst, NY: Prometheus Books; Wallach, W., Allen, C., (2008) Moral Machines: Teaching Robots Right from Wrong, , New York: Oxford University Press; Wallach, W., Deep Learning, AI Safety, Machine Ethics and Superintelligence (2015) Proceedings Joint Meeting of CEPE-IACAP, , Computer Ethics: Philosophical Enquiry and International Association for Computing and Philosophy; Bengio, Y., Goodfellow, I., Courville, A., (2016) Deep Learning, , http://www.deeplearningbook.org/, Cambridge, Mass: MIT Press; Sawyer, R.J., Robot Ethics (2007) Science, 318 (5853), p. 1037; Russell, S., Robotics: Ethics of Artificial Intelligence (2015) Nature News, 521, p. 7553; Yampolskiy, R.V., Attempts to Attribute Moral Agency to Intelligent Machines Are Misguided (2013) Proceedings of International Association of Computers and Philosophy; Chalmers, D., The Singularity: A Philosophical Analysis (2010) Journal of Consciousness Studies, 17 (9-10), pp. 7-65; Peters, T., (1996) For the Love of Children: Genetic Technology and the Future of the Family, , Louisville, KY: Westminster John Knox Press; Brown, W.S., Murphy, N.C., Newton Malony, H., (1998) Whatever Happened to the Soul?: Scientific and Theological Portraits of Human Nature, , Minneapolis, MN: Fortress Press; Peters, T., Theologians Testing Transhumanism (2015) Theology and Science, 13 (2), pp. 130-149; Foerst, A., Artificial Intelligence: Walking the Boundary (1996) Zygon, 31 (4), pp. 681-693; Foerst, A., Cog, a Humanoid Robot, and the Question of the Image of God (1998) Zygon 33:1, pp. 91-111; Foerst, A., Artificial Sociability: From Embodied AI Toward New Understandings of Personhood (1999) Technology in Society, 21 (4), pp. 373-386; Foerst, A., (2004) God in the Machine: What Robots Teach Us about Humanity and God, , New York: Dutton; Barbour, I.G., Neuroscience, Artificial Intelligence, and Human Nature: Theological and Philosophical Reflections (1999) Zygon, 34 (3), pp. 361-398; Barbour, I., (2002) Nature, Human Nature, and God, , Minneapolis, MN: Augsburg Fortress; Herzfeld, N.L., (2002) In Our Image: Artificial Intelligence and the Human Spirit, Theology and the Sciences, , Minneapolis, MN: Fortress Press; Herzfeld, N., Creating in Our Own Image: Artificial Intelligence and the Image of God (2002) Zygon, 37 (2), pp. 303-316; Geraci, R.M., Artificial Intelligence, Networks, and Spirituality (2010) Zygon, 45 (4), pp. 1003-1020; Turing, A.M., Computing Machinery and Intelligence (1950) Mind, 59 (236), pp. 433-460; Searle, J.R., Minds, Brains, and Programs (1980) Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 3 (3), pp. 417-424; Cole, D., The Chinese Room Argument (2014) Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, , http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/chinese-room/, (Summer 2014 Edition); Kegan, R., (2001) The Evolving Self: Problem and Process in Human Development, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Parker, K.A., (1998) The Continuity of Peirce’s Thought, pp. 156-157. , Nashville, TN: Vanderbilt University Press; Tillich, P., Jung, C., define symbol and sign differently from Peirce: for them, a symbol partakes of the reality to which it points and a sign simply points to it; Lakoff, G., Johnson, M., (1980) Metaphors We Live By, 4-5, p. 15. , Chicago: University of Chicago Press, For embodied metaphors, in particular; Steels, L., Fifty Years of AI: From Symbols to Embodiment-and Back (2007) 50 Years of Artificial Intelligence, , ed.

A.N. Whitehead’s understanding of the reciprocal cause-and-effect relation between constituent actual entities and the governing structure of the “society” to which they belong provides philosophical grounding for this new methodology and removes the danger of regarding systems as completely deterministic rather than open-ended and self-organizing. Likewise, a systems-oriented approach to the Christian doctrines of the Trinity, the Incarnation and Eschatology clears up residual ambiguities in the traditional understanding of those same beliefs. © 2017 Graduate Theological Union (CTNS Program).","Deacon, Terrence; emergence theory; Eschatology; Hoffmeyer, Jesper; Incarnation; Kauffman, Stuart; panpsychism; reciprocal causation; Trinity; universal intersubjectivity; Whitehead, A.N",,"Toulmin, S., (1982) The Return to Cosmology: Postmodern Science and the Theology of Nature, p. 272. , Berkeley, CA: University of California; Henry, G., (1998) Christianity and the Images of Science, pp. 21-31. , Macon, GA: Smith & Helwys; Whitehead, A.N., (1978) Process and Reality: An Essay in Cosmology, pp. 90-91. , Corrected edition, ed.

Hefner does not address these critiques directly, nor does he modify his own methodology sufficiently to avoid valid criticism.

Roger Shinn, 67–74, see; Barbour, I.G., (1970) Science and Secularity: The Ethics of Technology, , New York, Evanston and London: Harper & Row; It is interesting to note the extent to which Barbour anticipates these in his 1970 book. See e.g. Barbour, Science and Secularity, 84–85; There is a telling question mark in the title of Michael J. Reiss and Roger Straughan’s Improving Nature?: The Science and Ethics of Genetic Engineering (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2001, first published 1996). Perhaps the only modern author to insist on human’s improving, indeed redeeming, nature has been Ronald Cole-Turner in his The New Genesis: Theology and the Genetic Revolution (Louisville, Ky.: Westminster/John Knox Press, 1993), see especially ch.5; Though I do find a very ‘bullish’ affirmation of the new biotechnologies which has attracted a lot of suspicion in Europe. Indeed an important element in ‘the British perspective’ in environmental matters is the contrast between attitudes to GM crops here and in the US. See the papers by Celia Deane-Drummond et al. and myself in the forthcoming ReOrdering Nature: Theology and the New Genetics, ed. Celia Deane-Drummond and Bronislaw Szerszynski (Edinburgh: T&T Clark, forthcoming, 2002), also George Gaskell et al., “Worlds Apart?

Later, however, Barbour deployed some of the many critical responses White’s writing has evoked. See for example Ethics in an Age of Technology, 75–76; Barbour, I.G., (1972) Earth Might Be Fair: Reflections on Ethics, Religion and Society, , Englewood Cliffs, NJ.: Prentice-Hall; Barbour, I.G., Attitudes Towards Nature and Technology Earth Might Be Fair, p. 146. , in Barbour, ed., See also Arne Naess, “The Shallow and the Deep, Long-Range Ecology Movement. A Summary,” Inquiry 16 (1972), 95–100; Barbour, “Attitudes,” 159–160; As Don Marietta has noted, consideration of the value of systems as a whole should supplement, rather than supplanting, concern for the system’s components.

Marietta, Jr., For People and the Planet: Holism and Humanism in Environmental Ethics (Philadelphia, Pa.: Temple University Press, 1994); Barbour, “Attitudes,” 161; Barbour, “Attitudes,” 165; Morrison, R., (1999) The Spirit in the Gene: Humanity’s Proud Illusion and the Laws of Nature, pp. 14-53. , Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press; Though Barbour already sees the clouds gathering when he writes in 1980: ‘The later 1970s have seen a resurgence of neoconservatism and isolationism in the United States, with groups campaigning to get us out of the UN, and to spend more on weapons.’ I.G. Barbour, Theology, Environment and Human Values (New York: Praeger, 1980), 314. And later he, all too rightly as it has proved, has no illusions that the election as Vice-President of Senator Al Gore, the author of Earth in the Balance: Forging a New Common Purpose (London: Earthscan, 1992), will shift the momentum of US policy far in a ‘green’ direction. See I.G. Barbour, “Response to Critiques of Ethics in an Age of Technology,” Zygon 31:1 (1996), 101–110, especially p. 110; Barbour, I.G., (1973) Western Man and Environmental Ethics: Attitudes Towards Nature and Technology, , Reading, Ma.: Addison-Wesley; Barbour, I.G., Introduction Western Man, 11p. , in Barbour, ed, 1–16, especially, See also Celia Deane-Drummond, Creation through Wisdom: Theology and the New Biology (Edinburgh: T&T Clark, 2000); Barbour, “Introduction,” 16, see also “Attitudes,” 168; Lynn, W., Jr., Continuing the Conversation (1973) Western Man, pp. 63-64. , in Barbour, ed; Barbour, Technology, Environment and Human Values, 316; This concept can be found in a lecture given by René Dubos in 1969, even before James Lovelock’s formulation of the Gaia Hypothesis gave it an (albeit questionable) scientific status (see René Dubos, “A Theology of the Earth,” in Barbour, ed., Western Man., 43–54, especially 43– 44); Osborn, L., Archetypes, Angels and Gaia (2001) Ecotheology, 10, pp. 9-22. , for an original and thought-provoking theological ‘spin’ on Gaia; Lovelock, J., (1988) The Ages of Gaia, p. 212. , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Barbour, I.G., (1980) Technology, Environment and Human Values, , New York: Preager; The strength of feeling in this area in the UK may surprise some in the US. The tone of the following, from the front page of a major British newspaper on the opening day of the ‘Earth Summit’ in Johannesburg in August 2002, is indicative: ‘The slowest ship in the world’s convoy of environmental awareness is American public opinion. The bloated, resourcehungry American voter is the greatest obstacle to global sustainability. It is the US that blocks Kyoto, which will not even consider taxing international aviation fuel, which refuses to pick up the tab for preserving habitats outside its borders.’ The Independent, 26 August 2002, p1; He lists ecological thought as one of the diversity of counter-movements against structures of alienation of oppression (to which modernity has given rise). He seeks a ‘new naturalism.. not administered by the prince or the physicist’. See Michael McGonigle, “A New Naturalism: Is There a (Radical) Truth beyond the (Postmodern) Abyss?” Ecotheology 8 (2000), 8–39. My contention is rather that the natural scientist should be recognised as an invaluable consultant in the search for a wisdom held by ‘beings-in-community-in-nature’; (1993) The Body of God, , London: SCM Press; Peacocke, A., (1979) Creation and the World of Science: the Bampton Lectures, 1978, pp. 294-318. , Oxford: The Clarendon Press; Thinking Toward a Future (1996) Zygon, 31 (1), pp. 87-92. , Barbour seemed to respond to this in Religion and Science, by inserting some material on nature-centred spirituality into his basic schema (Barbour, Religion and Science, 95–98), but the material still does not seem entirely successfully integrated; (1992) The Search for a Livable World, , London and New York: Routledge; Only science can supply the data for evaluating threats to our environment arising from our technologies and our life-styles (2000) When Science Meets Religion, p. 29. , I.G.

Throughout, his focus is anthropological; Pope, J.P., Message to Pontifical Academy of Sciences on Evolution (1996) Origins, 26, p. 351. , This message was given five months after the Vatican Observatory and Center for Theology and the Natural Sciences sponsored a conference on evolutionary and molecular biology, held at the papal summer residence in Castel Gandolfo. The papers discussed at the conference in which Ian Barbour participated are found in Evolutionary and Molecular Biology, Scientific Perspectives on Divine Action; Barbour’s paper is entitled “Five Models of God and Evolution,” 419–442; Pius, X., Humani generis (“Concerning Certain False Opinions”) (1950) Acta Apostolicae Sedis, 42, pp. 575-576. , this encyclical was written to address the issue of biological evolution and its relation to the biblical accounts of creation and the scholastic version of creation theology were being debated in the 1940s. Although during Darwin’s lifetime the Vatican authorities did not place any of his books on the Index of Forbidden Books, nor did Pius IX mention Darwinian evolution in the Syllabus of Errors (1864), some Catholic theologians believed that evolution as described by scientists was unreasonable on philosophical grounds. Others, however, were beginning to explore the implications of the theory for theology. Although Pius XII did not condemn the speculations, he did express caution about the origin of the soul and about polygenetic theories of the origin of the human species. His reasons were theological and had to do with the uniqueness of humans as the only creatures that image God, of the universality of original sin and the universal need for salvation through Christ; Pope, J.P., Message to Pontifical Academy of Sciences on Evolution, 351. , The quote, as already noted, is Leo XIII’s Providentissimus Deus, #5; Pope, J.P., Message to Pontifical Academy of Sciences on Evolution, 351. , The quote, as already noted, is Leo XIII’s Providentissimus Deus, #5; The Roman Catholic form of creationism assumes that God creates every individual soul directly out of nothing by God (see Denzinger, Enchiridion Symbolorum, Definitionum et Declarationum de rebus fidei et morum, ed. Karl Rahner, 31st edition. (Freiburg i Br., 1960), D 738, 1100, 2327). This position first emerged early in Christianity. Hilary of Poitiers (c 315–367) argued that although flesh is always born of flesh, “the soul of the body [can] be from nowhere else than from God” in Hilary of Portiers, On the Trinity, book 10, trans; McKenna, S., (1954), (New York: Fathers of the Church, Inc, 4. In the Middle Ages, Thomas Aquinas also made a creationist claim when he argued that the rational soul of humans could be made only by [direct] creation, even though other life forms [species] could come into existence by generation and presumably, therefore, by evolution (although evolution would have been very foreign to Aquinas’s mind set), see the Summa Theologiae, I, q. 90, a. 2. (See also Aquinas, Summa Contra Gentiles, Book 2, q. 87 where he takes a creationist position to argue against the soul’s source being semen of the father.); “Message to Pontifical Academy of Sciences on Evolution,” 352. The quote is from Gaudium et spes (#24); John, P., II, Message to Pontifical Academy of Sciences on Evolution, p. 353. , It is important to bear in mind, however, that Christian eschatology is not dependent on Plato’s conception of the soul as by nature immortal although this belief is one of the contributing factors to Platonism’s adoption by many early Christian theologians. Christian eschatology is rooted in belief, not in the natural immortality of the soul, but in bodily resurrection, revealed in Jesus Christ; Peters, T., (1998) When Science Meets Religion, p. 131. , Barbour, George Coyne, S.J., of the Vatican Observatory holds a different opinion, seeing the papal message on evolution to be an expression of “openness in dialogue”; see his “Evolution and the Human Person: The Pope in Dialogue,” in Science and Theology, the New Consonance, edited by, (Boulder: Westview Press, In this case, I share the judgment of Barbour; see my “Biological Evolution and the Human Soul: A Theological Proposal for Generationism,” in Science and Theology, the New Consonance, 162–173; When Science Meets Religion, p. 129. , Barbour; When Science Meets Religion, p. 132. , Barbour; When Science Meets Religion, pp. 134-135. , Barbour; Fides et ratio, Preface, 318; Johnson, E.A., Presidential Address, Turn to the Heavens and Earth: Retrieval of the Cosmos in Theology (1996) Proceedings of the Catholic Theological Society of America, 51, p. 1; Johnson, E.A., Presidential Address, Turn to the Heavens and Earth: Retrieval of the Cosmos in Theology (1996) Proceedings of the Catholic Theological Society of America, 51, p. 1; Pope, J.P., II, Message to the Vatican Observatory Conference on Evolution and Molecular Biology, p. 1. , #2","Clifford, A.M.; University Core Curriculum, United States; email: clifford@iastate.edu",,"Routledge",14746700,,,,"English","Theology Sci.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014785757

Examination of revelatory experiences, especially Christ’s resurrection appearances, may be seen in terms of this broader interaction not only as solving certain historical puzzles, but as bringing to fruition Arthur Peacocke's hope for application to spiritual experience of understandings of divine action that have been developed within the science–theology dialogue. The pluralistic implications of this approach are examined, and the possibilities open to psychologists in relation to both interpretation and research strategies are outlined. It is stressed that what is required is not simply interdisciplinarity, as this is usually understood, but transdisciplinarity of the kind that questions the boundaries and methodologies accepted by specialists in one or other of the disciplines concerned. © 2016 Center for Theology and the Natural Sciences.","Divine action; Psychology of religion; Resurrection appearances; Revelation; Transdisciplinarity",,"note 39; Jeeves, M., (1997) Human Nature: Reflections on the Integration of Psychology and Christianity, , See e.g, Conshohocken: Templeton Foundation Press; Knight, C.C., (2001) Wrestling with the Divine: Religion, Science, and Revelation, , Minneapolis: Fortress; See note 46; It is, of course, possible to regard the resurrection appearance narratives in the New Testament as having no straightforward historical basis, and it is certainly the case that these narratives have emerged through complex oral and redactional processes. It is arguable, for example, that-as Norman Perrin has suggested in his book The Resurrection Narratives: A New Approach (London: SCM, 1977)-the original experiences may have been more like the visionary experience of St. Paul on the road to Damascus than like those that appear in the gospels. Nevertheless, the transformation of the disciples from a frightened and defeated group into a confident and death-defying one can only be accounted for, in my judgment, by some extraordinary experience of the “risen Christ” whom they proclaimed, even if the question of the content of that experience remains a complex one for the historian; Rahner, K., (1965) Studies in Modern Theology, p. 97. , Heidelberg: Herder; Rahner, K., (1965) Studies in Modern Theology, p. 114. , Heidelberg: Herder; Rahner, K., (1965) Studies in Modern Theology, p. 123. , Heidelberg: Herder; Rahner, K., (1965) Studies in Modern Theology, p. 124. , Heidelberg: Herder; Rahner, K., (1965) Studies in Modern Theology, p. 126. , Heidelberg: Herder; Schiavione, C.F., (1994) Rationality and Revelation in Rahner, p. 238. , New York: Peter Lang; Studies, pp. 138-139; Wallis, I., (2000) Holy Saturday Faith: A Theology of Easter’s Second Day, , For an interesting study of this aspect of the disciples’ reaction to the crucifixion and of their coming to a fuller recognition of its significance, see, London: SPCK; Von Balthasar, H.U., (1982) The Glory of the Lord: A Theological Aesthetics, 1, pp. 15-16. , Seeing the FormEdinburgh: T. & T, Clark; Schillebeeckx, E., (1980) Interim Report on the Books Jesus and Christ, pp. 80-81. , London: SCM; Selwyn, E.G., The Resurrection (1926) Essays Catholic and Critical-By Members of the Anglican Communion, pp. 279-319. , Edward Gordon Selwyn, London: SPCK; Knight, C.C., The Synoptic Problem: Some Methodological Considerations and a New Hypothesis (2016) Heythrop Journal, , A late dating for Matthew’s gospel is usually associated with the commonly accepted two-source hypothesis for the relationship between the synoptic gospels.

An exploration of Sherrard’s views will be found in Knight, The God of Nature: Incarnation and Contemporary Science (Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 2007) 61-68, and in; Peacocke, A., (1993) Theology for a Scientific Age: Being and Becoming-Natural, Divine and Human, p. 202. , London: SCM; Wrestling with the Divine; God of Nature; Parallels between my psychological-referential framework and that of John MacQuarrie-sometimes labeled as existential-ontological-have sometimes been commented on. My approach was, however, developed quite independently of MacQuarrie’s and on a different basis. While we may remain appreciative of MacQuarrie’s framework, it is arguable that my approach and nomenclature are preferable for two important reasons. First, the word psychological rather than existential is more appropriate because the approach I have outlined can be developed in terms of the psychology of religion, broadly conceived. While existentialism has had some good effects in theological discourse, it has brought to view nothing that can be explored in terms of science in the way that a theology with strong links to the psychology of religion potentially can. Second, the term referential rather than ontological is preferable because it is arguable that we can know nothing of the ontology of the divine reality to which our experience points. This argument may be based partly on a radically apophatic understanding of religious language (as found in strands of the patristic literature), and partly on the judgment that even when speaking of created things in scientific discourse, we can know nothing of the ontology of the entities of which we speak. In relation to this, the so-called “critical realism” that many see as a proper interpretation of both scientific and theological language is arguably in need of major modification. In the wake of the work of Mary Hesse, Rom Harre, and other philosophers of science, it is now coming to be recognized that scientific language should be interpreted in terms of a realism that focuses on structures rather than entities, and that our understanding of theological language should be modified in a similar way. See Knight, Wrestling With the Divine, 91-105; Knight, C.C., Homo Religiosus: A Theological Proposal for a Scientific and Pluralistic Age (2010) Human Identity at the Intersection of Science, Technology and Religion, pp. 25-38. , The five theses set out in what follows were first set out explicitly in, Nancey Murphy and Christopher C. KnightFarnham: Ashgate, They are repeated in a slightly different context in; Knight, C.C., Biological Evolution and the Universality of Spiritual Experience: Pluralistic Implications of a New Approach to the Thought of Teilhard de Chardin (2013) Journal of Ecumenical Studies, 48, pp. 58-70; Wrestling with the Divine, pp. 69-106. , For these latter arguments, see in particular; Morris, S.C., (2003) Life’s Solution: Inevitable Humans in a Lonely Universe, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; God of Nature, pp. 117-120; It is often assumed that any theological framework that denies “special” divine action is deistic, in the sense that God can be seen as no more than an “absentee landlord” whose action is only of the “general” sort that arises from the benign design of the cosmos, with which God now has essentially no connection. However, in God of Nature, I argue that any panentheistic framework will not be deistic, and I have argued, in particular, that a “naturalistic,” neo-Byzantine model, based on the thought of Maximus the Confessor, can provide a tenable panentheistic model for Christians that makes no distinction between “special” and “general” divine action; Brain Activity in Near-Death Experiencers During a Meditative State (2009) Resuscitation, 80, pp. 1006-1010. , Such research might seem difficult in view of the unpredictability and rarity of revelatory experience. However, given that certain types of religious “conversion” experience are more common, and are clearly related to the kind of experience explored here (and indeed might be regarded as secondary revelatory experiences), it might be possible to do scanning experiments during meditation on past experience of this kind, in a way comparable to that adopted with those who have had near-death experiences by Mario Beauregard, Jerome Courtemanche, and Vincent Panquette-see their paper, (I am grateful to Andrew Newberg for this suggestion in a private communication.); D’Aquili, E., Newberg, A.B., (1999) The Mystical Mind: Probing the Biology of Religious Experience, , Minneapolis: Fortress Press, See also: Andrew Newberg, Principles of Neurotheology (Farnham: Ashgate, 2010); Jung, C.G., (1959) Flying Saucers: A Modern Myth of Things Seen in the Sky, , The best general introduction to Jung’s thought is probably still Frieda Fordham, An Introduction to Jung’s Psychology, 3rd ed. (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1966). For an account of Jung’s understanding of visionary experience, however, the best short account is probably his own in the opening sections of, London: Routledge and Kegan Paul; Noll, R., (1994) The Jung Cult: Origins of a Charismatic Movement, , Even if, as I shall argue, we should not ignore Jung’s framework because of its supposed unfalsifiability, we must take into account the way in which aspects of Jung’s understanding are based on an unsustainable biologistic notion of the hereditary element of the collective unconscious, and also recognize that aspects of his thinking rely as much on nineteenthand early twentieth-century esoteric speculation as on scientific evidence, Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, provides a fascinating historical study of this background to Jung’s thinking; Kihlstrom, J.F., The Cognitive Unconscious (1987) Science, 237, pp. 1445-1452. , This term was first introduced in an influential article by; Uleman, J.S., Introduction (2005) The New Unconscious, pp. 3-15. , Ran R. Hassin, James S. Uleman, and John A. Barr, Oxford: Oxford University Press; Lakatos, I., (1978) The Methodology of Scientific Research Programs, pp. 94-96. , Here it is important to recognize that, especially in his later work, Popper recognized his falsifiability criterion as a particular application of the more general notion of criticizability, and acknowledged the scientific usefulness of certain unfalsifiable beliefs at the heart of what he called metaphysical research programs. See the interesting comments on this in, John Worrall and Gregory CurrieCambridge: Cambridge University Press, For a particularly interesting interpretation of this movement in Popper’s thought, which goes beyond Popper’s own thoughts; Bartley, W., Theories of Demarcation Between Science and Metaphysics (1968) Problems in the Philosophy of Science, pp. 40-119. , I. Lakatos and A. MusgraveAmsterdam: North Holland; Greenwood, S.F., Émile Durkheim and C.G. Jung: Structuring a Transpersonal Sociology of Religion (1990) Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 29, pp. 482-495; Lakoff, G., Johnson, M., (1981) Metaphors We Live By, , Hunt has suggested that Jung’s collective unconscious is, in socio-cultural terms, “comparable to Durkheim’s … concept of ‘collective consciousness,’ which he understands as most apparent in the ‘collective representations’ of myth, ritual, and religion.” Using the ideas of George Lakoff and Mark Johnson about the centrality of metaphor in human thinking, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, Hunt goes on to note that this parallel “takes on a cross-cultural component once we add in the largely unconscious roots of archetypical imagination in Lakoff and Johnson’s ‘image schemas’-as also embedded within the expressive patterns of physical and animate nature, and so continuously available as exteriorized sources of metaphor.” In terms of this understanding, he argues, fully developed mythological thinking is, as; Jung, W., Not a Simple Hangover from Childhood Animism, but is Itself Metacognitive. It is an Expressive Cognition of Underlying Cognitive Processes, but Here on the Grounds of Cognitive Psychology and Sociology.; Hunt, H.T., A Collective Unconscious Reconsidered: Jungs Archetypal Imagination in the Light of Contemporary Psychology and Social Science,” (2012) Journal of Analytical Psychology, 57, p. 80. , A rapprochement between Jung and the contemporary human sciences may thus, in Hunt’s view, rest less on the relevance of Jung’s problematical notion of a biologistic collective unconscious than on a reinscribing of an archetypal imagination as the phenomenological and empirical core of Jungian psychology; Three main points-over and above the observations of Greenwood and Hunt-are relevant here: (i) Popper’s notion of falsifiability-as was observed in note 39-is in fact more subtle than many psychologists recognize; in practice, their appeal to it often has more in common with the discredited notions of logical positivism than with the thought of Popper himself. (ii) Popper’s own view-certainly in its earlier forms-is itself only approximately applicable to the practice of science. A contemporary “Popperian” approach must, at the very least, take into account the views of Imre Lakatos, in which a distinction is made between core theories (which are not easily given up when discordant data is found) and auxiliary hypotheses (which are more readily discarded when challenged by discordant data.) (iii) The third point is, however, perhaps the most important one. This is that when human beings are subjected to scientific enquiry-whether through psychology, sociology or any other of the human sciences-then, from a philosophical perspective, complex criteriaof the kind explored by Jürgen Habermas and others-necessarily come into play if adequate conceptual schemes are to be established. For a good argument based on this insight, see Philip Clayton, Explanation from Physics to Theology: An Essay in Rationality and Religion (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1989), in which it is argued that the rationality of theology may be recognized in part through acknowledgement of the way in which the human sciences act as a bridge between the hard natural sciences and theology; A classic early attempt to demolish theology as unfalsifiable was an essay by a scholar who later in life seems to have become a kind of deist. This was Anthony Flew, whose paper, “Theology and Falsification,” first published in an ephemeral undergraduate journal in 1950, was republished in Anthony Flew and Alasdair C. Macintyre, New Essays in Philosophical Theology (London: SCM, 1955). Against this view, it has been argued that, at its best, theology is truly open to criticism of a kind appropriate to the degree of complexity with which it deals, so that it can be defended as an activity of rational agents-see Knight, Wrestling With the Divine, 43-67; also Clayton, Explanation; In the current “science-theology dialogue”-in which the term consonance is regularly used to describe the dialogue’s goal-it is noteworthy that relatively little work moves beyond what is essentially theological apologetic. See the comments in Knight, Wrestling With the Divine, 1-9; Wilson, E.O., (1998) Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge, , The unity of knowledge associated with transdisciplinarity is, it should be noted, based on an understanding very different to that involved in the reductionistic use of this concept associated with imperialistic claims about scientific method, as set out in, New York: Knopf, Those who take theology with due seriousness will necessarily have a different understanding to Wilson’s, and the present essay represents one particular approach to how this different understanding may be developed; The term transdisciplinarity seems to have been first proposed by the psychologist Jean Piaget in 1970. He defined it in terms of an approach that is not limited (as interdisciplinarity usually is) to recognizing the interactions or reciprocities between specialized fields of research. Rather, it locates these links inside a total system without stable boundaries between the disciplines. See; Apostel, L., Berger, G., Briggs, A., Michaud, G., (1972) Interdisciplinarity: Problems of Teaching and Research in Universities, p. 144. , Paris: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, This kind of approach has been explored in detail in; Nicolescu, B., (2002) Manifesto of Transdisciplinarity, , New York: State University of New York, It should perhaps be emphasized that my approach here, while consonant with Nicolescu’s, does not imply full agreement with all his prescriptions for transdisciplinary work. He is, I believe, a pioneer whose work must be built on in an appreciative but critical way, using the experience of attempts to work in a transdisciplinary way-as in the present essay-to modify his understanding where necessary","Knight, C.C.; International Society for Science and Religion, United Kingdom; email: cck26@cam.ac.uk",,"Routledge",14746700,,,,"English","Theology Sci.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84999851911

For this reason, he suggests replacing “teleological” with “teleonomic” and “teleomatic.” He defines the first term as a process or behavior “that owes its goal directedness to the operation of a program.” The other one refers in his view to “processes that reach an end-state caused by natural laws” (Ernst Mayr, “Teleological and Teleonomic: A New Analysis,” in Evolution and the Diversity of Life. Selected Essays [Cambridge, MA: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1976], 387-390, 403). Mayr also compares his idea of an operational program in nature to a computer program: “The purposive action of an individual, insofar as it is based on the properties of its genetic code, therefore is no more nor less purposive than the actions of a computer that has been programmed to respond appropriately to various inputs. It is, if I may say so, a purely mechanistic purposiveness” (Ernst Mayr, Toward a New Philosophy of Biology: Observations of an Evolutionist [Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1988], 31). Mayr seems to forget about the fact that the computer program has its conscious designer. His analogy begs a question of the source of the properties of the genetic code. More recently, biological aspects of teleology, understood as natural and intrinsic goal-directedness proper to living organisms, and not a causal activity of future goals on the present situation, has been defended by Denis Walsh in his “Teleology,” in The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy of Biology, ed. Michael Ruse (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008), 113-137. 6. See Deacon and Cashman, “Steps,” 417-418; The most important references to Aquinas on divine action in relation to the four causes, include: (1) with reference to material cause: ST I, 14, 11, ad 3; ST I, 44, 2, co.; ST I, 44, 4, ad 4; (2) with reference to formal cause: In phys.

But closer analysis of his writings shows that Deacon does not succeed in doing away with downward causation altogether. For we find him discussing, on numerous occasions, the “higher order constraint” preventing the disruption of the synergy between the component morphodynamic processes; the organization of teleodynamic systems enabling them to preserve and regenerate their own essential constraints, and to interact with the environment in a way that sustains supportive, and compensates for unsupportive, influences; the self-compression and self-reference of teleodynamic systems; the spontaneous regularizing tendency to become more organized and globally constrained over time, which is exercised at the level of morphodynamic systems; and the spontaneous tendency to eliminate constraints, increasing global entropy and reaching thermodynamic equilibrium, exercised by homeodynamic phenomena. All these properties, tendencies, and actions, proper for all three levels of Deacon’s dynamical model of emergence, are delineated in implicitly causal terms, which are reminiscent of the language of downward causation used by proponents of the classical view of emergence. The metaphysical aspects of both descriptions are equally unclear; Deacon, T., Incomplete, p. 203; Deacon, T., Incomplete, p. 20312. , 14, 45; Steps, p. 419; Steps, p. 420; Steps, p. 418; Here I agree with Deacon and Cashman saying that although constraints “are intrinsically relational phenomena … reflected in relationships between degrees of freedom that are excluded and those that are not excluded,” we cannot forget that “these are always degrees of freedom of some physical process of change” (ibid., 420). To this I add that these are processes engaging concrete entities that are decisive for their nature; What is more, the reflection presented here shows that teleology, if separated and detached from Aristotle’s fourfold division of causes and his philosophy of nature and metaphysics, does not stand. This also suggests that the dialogue between natural science and philosophy requires from the former an acceptance of the unique and irreducible character of the aspects of reality described by the latter; Steps, p. 427; Steps, p. 427; “There is something with regard to God which is entirely unknown to man in this life, namely, what God is (quid est Deus) … and this is so because man’s knowledge begins with the things that are connatural to him, namely, sensible creatures, which are not adequate to represent the divine essence. Nevertheless man can know God from creatures of this sort in three ways, as Dionysius says in the Divine Names. First, through causality. For, since such creatures are imperfect and changeable, they must be reduced to some unchangeable and perfect principle. And from this we know that God exists (de Deo an est). Second, by way of excellence (per viam excellentiae). For all things are reduced to a first principle, not as to a proper and univocal cause, as man begets man, but as to a universal and transcendent cause. And from this we know that He is above all things. Third, by way of negation, because if He is a transcendent cause, nothing which is in creatures can belong to Him …”(Superadrom.I,lect.6).SeealsoSCGI,30;III,49.OnAquinas’emphasisontheimportance of analogy in theology and the way it protects as from the fallacy of both univocal and equivocal predication of God, see ST I, 13, 5; Sherman, J., Deacon, T.W., Teleology for the Perplexed: How Matter Began to Matter (2007) Zygon, 42, pp. 899-900","Tabaczek, M.; Graduate Theological Union in BerkeleyUnited States; email: mtabaczek@gmail.com",,"Routledge",14746700,,,,"English","Theology Sci.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84999836326

And the top would not spin at all if the spinner’s hand was still present. Basil’s image of the conservation of momentum in a spinning top in the absence of the initial mover was passed down by Christian philosopher, scientist, and theologian John Philoponus (490-570 CE) and then introduced to the Middle Ages through various Syriac Christian and Arabic commentators.

In choosing to use the language of ontology instead of metaphysics, I am following a methodological distinction adopted by the theologian Jan-Olav Henriksen in much of his own work regarding a “post-metaphysical” approach to ontology. By this he means that a post-metaphysical approach does not start with something before and beyond history. Rather, it starts with a history which, when we speak about it in certain ways, points to something beyond what happens, but still is present in what happens.” Desire, Gift, and Recognition: Christology and Postmodern Philosophy (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 2009), 25. Henriksen’s language here is very broad, but it suggests that the best contemporary way to generate ontological significance is by beginning with the plurality and difference of things (beings) in the world and then formulate conceptions about Being. This is not metaphysics in a traditional sense, but it also does not lead to the evacua- tion of metaphysical thinking as has sometimes been supposed. While Deacon and Cashman suggest they are searching for a “metaphysics” of incompleteness, following Henriksen’s distinction would suggest they are developing a post-metaphysical ontology of incompleteness; Pryor, A., (2014) The God Who Lives: Investigating the Emergence of Life and the Doc- Trine of God, , A far more detailed account of what is at stake in interpreting Deacon’s work on this point appears in, Eugene, OR: Pickwick Publications, chapter 3; Deacon, T., (2011) Incomplete Nature: How Mind Emerged from Matter, p. 223. , New York: W.W.

Roughly put, the idea is that one must first know what exists or might exist before one can speculate about the nature of that existence. With regard to my interpretation of Deacon and Cashman, I am suggesting we employ a variation of the priority thesis. Instead of beginning from the language of exist- ing metaphysical schemas that assume a different sort of existent stuff, I am suggesting we take absolutely seriously the idea that teleodynamics is an adequate way to characterize onto-logically existing things and then work from this stipulation that teleodynamic phenomenon exist to eliminate metaphysical systems that cannot sufficiently account for the distinctive features of this phenomenon. On the priority thesis consider; Russell, R.J., (2012) Time in Eternity: Pannenberg, Physics, and Eschatology in Creative Mutual Interaction, , This itself is a substantially difficult issue apart from its placement within an operating ontology.

Contemporary fossil and genetic evidence, though, have revealed what can accurately be described as an extinct ape species as ancestral to the human lineage. The persistence of ambiguous terms in popular science writing may be interpreted as a form of anthropocentric rhetorical discourse. Nonetheless, while such discourse is often justified in terms of increasing the public understanding of science, it may also mitigate (whether consciously intended or not) religion-based resistance to evolutionary theory. © 2016 Center for Theology and the Natural Sciences.","Anthropocentrism; Creationism; Human evolution; Pithecophobia; Popular science writing; Rhetoric",,"Roberts, J.H., (1988) Darwinism and the Divine in America: Protestant Intellectuals and Organic Evolution, 1859-1900, p. 104. , Madison: University of Wisconsin Press; Korsmeyer, J.D., (1998) Evolution and Eden: Balancing Original Sin and Contemporary Science, pp. 20-70. , Mahwah, NJ: Paulist Press; Numbers, R.L., (1992) The Creationists: The Evolution of Scientific Creationism, pp. 37-53. , New York: Alfred A.

These models are then used to evaluate an argument against theistic belief based on developments in the cognitive science of religion. It is argued that even if the processes that produce theistic belief are unreliable, this is insufficient to show that explaining away takes place. Indeed, given the difficulty of showing that the conditions for explaining away are met, it is very unlikely that such an argument can succeed. © 2016 Center for Theology and the Natural Sciences.","Bayesian reasoning; Cognitive science of religion; Evolutionary debunking arguments; Explaining away; Explanation; Models of science and religion",,"Wellman, M.P., Henrion, M., Explaining ‘Explaining Away,' (1993) IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 15, pp. 287-2920; Glass, D.H., Can Evidence for Design Be Explained Away?

Nietzsche's genealogical argument against theism and Darwin's case against Paley's “old argument of design in nature” are famous examples. In order for EAAs to have their negative force, they must satisfy several conditions. After clarifying these conditions, I focus in on one in particular: the two hypotheses in question offer potential explanations that compete with one another. I develop a formal account of what it takes for potential explanations to compete, and I use this account to argue that EAAs are often misapplied today. This is due to the fact that philosophers often fail to appreciate the subtle line dividing competing from non-competing explanations. © 2016 Center for Theology and the Natural Sciences.","Bayesianism; Evolutionary theory; Explaining away arguments; Explanatory reasoning; Hypothesis competition; Intelligent design",,"Nietzsche, F., (1886) Human, All Too Human, 1, p. 133. , trans.

In this paper I argue that two proposals made by cosmologists fail to explain away the universe's beginning, and that science is powerless to explain away the more fundamental question as to why there is a universe at all.

Prior to the Darwinian revolution, the order of biological organisms was often taken as a sign of their divine Creator. It is also commonly argued that Darwinian evolutionary theory as a good explanation for the adaptive complexity of biology reveals this appearance to be merely an illusion. However, in recent philosophical discussion several defenses of the compatibility of divine design and Darwinian evolution have emerged. These defenses insist not only that divine design and evolution are compatible, but even that biological organisms can continue to function as pointers to the Creator, even in a Darwinian cosmos. This article explores and extends these recent arguments. I analyze four different strategies for arguing that the wisdom of the Creator is apparent in biological organisms. The basic underlying assumption is that the products of some larger whole can reflect the rationality and designedness of that whole. © 2016 Center for Theology and the Natural Sciences.","Design arguments; Evolution; Intelligent Design; Theistic evolutionism",,"Paley, W., (2008) Natural Theology [1802], , Oxford: Oxford University Press, chapter 27; Calvin, (1989) Institutes of the Christian Religion, p. 51. , Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans; Woolford, T., (2011) Natural Theology and Natural Philosophy in the Late Renaissance, , PhD diss., University of Cambridge; Sudduth, M., (2009) The Reformed Objection to Natural Theology, , Ashgate; Darwin, C., (1958) The Autobiography of Charles Darwin, , ed.

This paper develops an empirically motivated debunking argument and defends it against objections. First, we introduce the empirical and epistemological background. Second, we develop and defend the main argument, the debunking argument from false god beliefs. Third, we characterize and evaluate the most prominent religious debunking argument to date: the debunking argument from insensitivity. It is found that insensitivity-based arguments are problematic, which makes them less promising than the debunking argument from false god beliefs. © 2016 Center for Theology and the Natural Sciences.","Cognitive science of religion; Evolutionary debunking arguments; Genealogy of religious belief; Polytheism; Religious epistemology; Theism",,"Barrett, J., (2004) Why Would Anyone Believe in God?, , Lanham, MD: Alta Mira; Boyer, P., (2001) Religion Explained, , New York: Basic Books; Murray, M.J., Schloss, J.P., Evolutionary Accounts of Religion and the Justification of Religious Belief (2013) Debating Christian Theism, pp. 242-258. , ed.

In the second place, Irenaeus' actual account of sin and the Fall is no more adequate to the problems posed by modern evolution than Augustine's.

Organized by faculty members at a religion-based academy called the ""Immutable Creeds University"" (ICU), the goal of the Symposium was to generate candid discussion on two major questions of interest to both traditional theology and the contemporary cognitive sciences: (1) Why do people believe in God? and (2) Is that belief justified? Responses to these questions were posed and discussed by representatives of: (a) Pre-scientific creedal Christianity, (b) Scientifically informed Christian theology, and (c) Comprehensive naturalism.

Thus it follows that the essence of our selves as human beings is simply the information housed in the neural connections of our brain. If this is so, then the self could be reproduced digitally. Such a cybernetic immortality introduces a new Cartesian dualism that separates mind from body, locating the self wholly in the mind. This view contrasts with the traditionally Christian view, that humans are created and best understood as being in the image of God - an image found in our rational intellect, our embodied agency, and our relationships. Our sense of self is incomplete without all three. We are neither just a mind nor just a body, but a mind that is both part and product of our human body, embedded within the larger environment of the physical world and human culture. Our knowledge, functioning, and self-understanding is shaped and acquired by and through our bodies. Without a body, we also cannot feel emotion, and thus have neither human-like intelligence nor compassion. The dreams of cybernetic immortality fail to capture the full nature of what it means to be human and are illusory hopes for a form of immortality not requiring the action of a supernatural being. Any hope for immortality is best found, as Niebuhr noted, beyond the scope of history. Further, this new dualism leads us to grandiose delusions - Niebuhr's sin of pride - regarding what we can accomplish in the here and now, delusions that are harmful to both our sense of self and to our capacity to love one another. © 2016 Center for Theology and the Natural Sciences.","Cybernetic immortality; Dualism; Embodied cognition; Emotion; Niebuhr; Resurrection",,"Crick, F., (1994) The Astonishing Hypothesis: The Scientific Search for the Soul, p. 3. , New York: Scribner's; Kurzweil, R., (1999) The Age of Spiritual Machines, p. 128. , New York: Viking; Kurzweil, R., (2005) The Singularity Is Near: When Machines Transcend Human Biology, , New York: Viking; Kaku, M., (2014) The Future of the Mind, p. 275. , New York: Doubleday; Enriquez, J., Head Transplants?, , http://edge.org/response-detail/26058; Green, J., 'Bodies-that is, human lives': A re-examination of human nature in the bible (1998) Whatever Happened to the Soul, pp. 155-159. , ed.

Descartes proposed his famous dualism, res cogitans (mental reality) plus res extensa (physical reality). With Isaac Newton and classical physics, res extensa won in Western science and with it, we lost our minds; we lost our subjective pole. Quantum mechanics has seemed to many, since its formulation in the Schrödinger equation in 1926, to hint beyond physics to a role for the human conscious observer in quantum measurement. At least two interpretations of quantum mechanics, or its extension - the latter by Penrose and Hameroff, and the former by myself - suggest a new panpsychism where conscious awareness and possibly free will occur at quantum measurements anywhere in the universe. If so, then we live in a vastly participatory universe. More: entangled quantum variables may conceivably share some form of consciousness and free will, whether embodied in us, or living forms elsewhere in the universe, or disembodied; hence, something like cosmic mind or minds are not ruled out. If true, life anywhere in the universe will have evolved with mind and free will.

Second, the basics of Neoplatonic theological metaphysics will be explained.

In light of recent advances in the fields of cognitive science of religion (CSR), neurotheology and philosophy of technology this paper follows the contemporary neuroethics debate on the subject of moral bioenhancement and engages it inside an imago Dei narrative. To explore this possibility we first establish some major points in the contemporary imago Dei debate, especially the substantial and relational aspect and some of its important interpretations. We then move to an exploration of the very possibility of moral/cognitive bioenhancement, as well as some concrete pitfalls and opportunities, inside the imago Dei narrative. Lastly, we try to portray a wider theological picture in which we engage humanity as both sacred and technological being living in a dynamic cosmic environment we are called to sanctify through the election offered to us by the Reedemer. To establish this we contemplate on the relationship between our eschatological fulfillment, the process of theosis, and the being and role of technology itself. © 2015 © 2015 Center for Theology and the Natural Sciences.","Human enhancement; Imago Dei; Moral enhancement; Theology of Technology; Transhumanism; Ultrahumanism",,"Agar, N., Whereto transhumanism? the literature reaches a critical mass (2007) Hastings Center Report, 37 (3), pp. 12-17; Raus, K., Focquaert, F., Schermer, M., Specker, J., Sterckx, S., On defining moral enhancement: A clarificatory taxonomy (2014) Neuroethics, 7, pp. 263-273; Aquinas, T., IaIIae Prologue; Boyd, C.A., (2007) A Shared Morality: A Narrative Defense of Natural Law Ethics, p. 57. , (Grand Rapids, MI: Brazos Press; Torrance, A., Is there a distinctive human nature?

Their systems of thought, however, remain open to the new data, offering an essential contribution to the ongoing debate between scientific, philosophical, and theological aspects of the theory of evolution. After discussing some key issues of substance metaphysics in its encounter with the theory of evolution (hylomorphism, transformism of species, teleology, chance, the principle of proportionate causation), I present a Thomistic response to its major hypotheses. Concerning the philosophy of Aquinas, I trace what might be seen as a preliminary description of natural selection in his commentary on Aristotle's Physics. Turning toward theology, besides addressing the topics that were referred to in the past - such as: Aquinas reading of Genesis, his account of creation as dependence in being, secondary and instrumental causality, and univocal/equivocal predication of God - I bring into discussion Thomas concept of the perfection of the universe, which has been virtually unused in this context. © 2015 Center for Theology and the Natural Sciences.","Aquinas; Aristotle; Chance; Divine causality; Evolution; Hylomorphism; Natural selection; Perfection of the universe; Teleology",,"Barbour, I., (1997) Religion and Science: Historical and Contemporary Issues, pp. 295-304. , San Francisco: Harper Collins; Clayton, P., Toward a constructive christian theology of emergence (2007) Evolution and Emergence.

We begin by making clearer a certain problem that randomness has been thought to pose to theism. We then discuss recent criticisms of certain contemporary solutions to this problem that emphasize the value of an autonomous creation. From there, we propose a fresh way of understanding the value of a semi-autonomous creation that does not succumb to these recent critiques. Our end goal is to explore new reasons God might have to value randomness. In particular, we highlight two plausible, interrelated candidate values: (1) There are certain aesthetic properties that a partially random, self-forming creation enjoys; and (2) Such a creation grants God and creatures certain pleasures, such as wonder, anticipation, curiosity, surprise, and appreciation. In articulating our version of the autonomy defense, we position it within two opposing accounts of divine providence, specifically open theism and simple foreknowledge. © 2015 Center for Theology and the Natural Sciences.","Aesthetic; Autonomy of creation defense; Chance; Creation and Providence; Randomness",,"Stephen Gunter, W., (2012) Arminius and His Declaration of Sentiments: An Annotated Translation with Introduction and Theological Commentary, p. 139. , Waco, TX: Baylor University Press; Heppe, H., (1950) Reformed Dogmatics: Set Out and Illustrated from the Sources, Rev. and Ed.

This idea is essential to Mormonism, which provides a religious framework consistent with naturalism and supportive of human transformation. Mormon transhumanists are not limited to traditional or popular accounts of religion, and embrace opportunities and risks of technological evolution. Although usually considered secular, transhumanism has some religious origins and sometimes functions as religion. Accelerating change contextualizes a Mormon transhumanist narrative of common expectations, aspirations, and parallels between Mormonism and transhumanism.

Transhumanism and Christianity divide on how we think about the cause of the changes that lie ahead for humanity. For transhumanists, the cause or the agent of human transcendence is technology. For Christians, it is grace, the underserved goodness of God who gives life and wholeness to the creation. Our core question is whether it is proper for Christian theology to see technology as contributing in any way to the future that a gracious God has in store for the creation.

They require the ability to construct a non-biological (e.g., electronic) substrate that can model the functioning human brain, including the ability for consciousness (self-awareness) and a means for uploading into this artificial mind the contents of one's mortal life experiences. The individuals who have speculated most comprehensively on this include Ted Chu, Raymond Kurzweil, and Martine Rothblatt.1 © 2015 Center for Theology and the Natural Sciences.","Consciousness uploading; Cybernetic cloud; Cybernetic immortality; Embodiment; Emotional valence; Meaning-narrative; Posthumanism; Supportive matrix; Technological evolution; Time-sense",,"Chu, T., (2014) Human Purpose and Transhuman Potential: A Cosmic Vision for Our Future Evolution, , San Rafael, CA: Origin Press; Kaku, M., (2014) The Future of the Mind: The Scientific Quest to Understand, Enhance, and Empower the Mind, , New York: Doubleday; Kurzweil, R., (2013) How to Create A Mind: The Secret of Human Thought Revealed, , London: Penguin; Rothblatt, M., (2014) Virtually Human: The Promise and the Peril of Digital Immortality, , New York: St. Martin's Press; (2006) The Singularity is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology, , London: Penguin; Gelernter, D., Artificial intelligence is lost in the woods (2007) Technology Review, 110 (4), pp. 62-70. , July/ August; Churchland, P., (2013) Touching A Nerve: Our Brains, Our Selves, , New York: Norton; Dennett, D., (1992) Consciousness Explained, , Boston, MA: Back Bay; Stix, G., Jacking into the brain (2008) Scientific American, 299 (5), pp. 56-61. , November; The future of the mind (2014) Scientific American Mind, 25 (6), pp. 29-45. , November-December; Robert, A., Burton, (2013) A Skeptic's Guide to the Mind: What Neuroscience Can and Cannot Tell Us about Ourselves, , New York: St. Martin's Griffin; Newberg, A., D'Aquill, E., Rause, V., (2002) Why God Won't Go Away: Brain Science and the Biology of Belief, , New York: Ballan-tine; Kripal, J., Visions of the impossible; How 'fantastic' stories unlock the nature of consciousness (2014) The Chronicle Review, , April; (2014) Utne Reader, 184, pp. 60-69. , Fall; Rothblatt, Virtually Human; Goleman, D., (2006) Social Intelligence, , New York: Bantam; De Waal, F., (2009) The Age of Empathy, , New York: Harmony Books; Jay Lifton, R., (1993) The Protean Self: Human Resilience in An Age of Fragmentation, , New York: Basic Books; Truett Anderson, W., (1997) The Future of the Self: Exploring the Post-identity Society, , New York: Tarcher Putnam; Kenneth, J., Gergen, (1991) The Saturated Self: Dilemmas of Identity in Contemporary Life, , New York: Basic Books; Gottschall, J., (2012) The Storytelling Animal: How Stories Make Us Human, , Boston: Mariner; Kurtz, E., Ketcham, K., (2002) The Spirituality of Imperfection: Storytelling and the Search for Meaning, , New York: Bantam Books; Dan, P., McAdams, (1997) The Stories We Live By: Personal Myths and the Making of the Self, , New York: Guilford; Toulmin, S., Goodfield, J., (1965) The Discovery of Time, , Chicago University of Chicago Press; Dere-Siewicz, W., How the novel made the modern world (2014) The Atlantic, 313 (5), pp. 88-99; Hsu, J., The secrets of storytelling: Our love of storytelling reveals the workings of the mind (2008) Scientific American Mind, 19 (4), pp. 46-51; (2013) Time Reborn: From the Crisis in Physics to the Future of the Universe, , Boston, MA; Mariner Books; Thinking in Time; Ross, V., Left in the past: Our brain may not be able to conceptualize time without a proper understanding of space (2014) Scientific American Mind, 25 (14), p. 10; Sandra, B.-K., Matthew, B., (2008) The Body Has A Mind Ofits Own, , New York: Random House; Noe, A., (2009) Out OfOur Heads: Why You Are Not Your Brain, and Other Lessons from the Biology of Consciousness, , New York: Hill and Wang; (1995) An Anthropologist on Mars, , New York: Knopf; (1987) The Man Who Mistook His Wife for A Hat and Other Clinical Tales, , New York: Harper Perennial; Antonio, R., Damasio, (1994) Descartes' Error: Emotion, Reason, and the Human Brain, , Kirkwood, NY: Putnam; Edward, O., Wilson, (2014) The Meaning of Human Existence, 169, p. 180. , New York: Norton; David Steindl-Rast, B., (1984) Gratefulness, the Heart OfPrayer: An Approach to Life in Fullness, , Ramsey, NJ: Paulist Press; Rothblatt Virtually Human, p. 294; Unready to wear (1968) Welcome to the Monkey House, pp. 229-243. , 1953, New York: Dell; Chu, Human Purpose; Kurzweil, How to Create A Mind; Kurzweil, How to Create A Mind, p. 281. , 282; Futurism (2014) Inside Man, , CNN, April 20, with Morgan Spurlock; Hacking the soul: New technologies that look inside the mind will make it possible to change what we think, feel and remember (2014) Technology Review, 117 (4), pp. 20-67; Garreau'S, J., (2005) Radical Evolution: The Promise and Peril of Enhancing Our Minds, Our Bodies-and What It Means to Be Human, , New York: Broadway, especially chapter 5, Hell; Ezekiel, J.E., Why i hope to die at 75 (2014) The Atlantic, 314 (3), pp. 74-81","Kellogg, N.R.; Sonoma State University (CSU)United States; email: nelson.kellogg@sonoma.edu",,"Routledge",14746700,,,,"English","Theology Sci.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946164725

In this paper, coming from a Roman Catholic perspective, I refute four myths associated with these claims: that the Church materially opposes life extension, that it conceptually opposes the very idea of life extension, that it opposes human genetic manipulation, and that it opposes letting people die in hospitals. I then propose that there are four real tensions that are much more significant: that material immortality is highly improbable, that injustice and inequality are major concerns, that transhuman omnipotence is impossible, and that utopianism is extremely dangerous. © 2015 Center for Theology and the Natural Sciences.","bioethics; Catholic; Christian ethics; enhancement; moral theology; post-humanism; Transhumanism",,"Roman catholicism and transhumanism (2014) Transhuman Visions Conference, , Religion and Transhumanism, Piedmont, CA: May 10; The Conference Description and Schedule Are, , http://brighterbrains.org/articles/entry/religion-and-transhumanism-the-future-of-faith-ethics-and-philosophy-may-10, Hank Pellisier's Brighter Brains website; Conference Videos Are, , https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbIPMPVrfXYBNKOldV2v7YeBHiF4rqGYB, Mormon Transhumanist Association, YouTube channel; (2014) The Conference Description and Schedule Are, , http://brighterbrains.org/articles/entry/transhuman-visions-san-francisco-conference-tickets-on-sale-now, Hank Pellisier's Brighter Brains, website accessed November 17; Conference Videos Are, , https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeMMREuUaUQAVMdmhLO5pJjaJoYyRi4-2, the Eternal Life Fan, YouTube channel; Roen horn (2014) Transhuman Visions Conference, 1. , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ACt3FPc5q8&list=PLeMMREuUaUQAVMdmhLO5pJjaJoYyRi4-2&index=10, Roen Horn, San Francisco, CA: February 1, minute 1:40-2:30, accessed November 17, 2014, video; Ray kurzweil (2005) The Singularity is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology, p. 372. , New York: Viking/Penguin; Peters, T., Progress and provolution: Will transhumanism leave sin behind?

Whitehead and C.S. Peirce. Peirce postulated a habit-forming tendency or inbuilt potentiality of the cosmic process as a whole to move over time toward ever greater organization and more complex structure. But he is vague on how ""the law of the mind"" applies to nature below the level of human self-awareness. Whitehead's notion of actual entities (momentary self-constituting subjects of experience) as the ""final real things of which the world is made up"" logically allows for some primitive form of subjectivity with the requisite potentiality for habit-formation at all levels of existence and activity within nature. In addition, Whitehead's notion of structured societies made up of subsocieties with a ""regnant"" subsociety seems philosophically to justify the new emphasis on bottom-up rather than top-down causation in the emergence of more complex levels of existence and activity within the life-sciences. © 2014 Center for Theology and the Natural Sciences.","A.N.

We analyzed texts representing Young Earth creationism (YEC) and intelligent design (ID) for their theological content and implications by assessing their position in central issues of systematic theology. YEC proponents emphasize the young age of the Earth and the necessity of literal interpretation of Genesis as prerequisites for the Fall and redemption. ID accepts the geological age of the planet, but requires intervention during evolution. YEC maintained the traditional characteristics of the Christian God (omnipotence, omniscience, benevolence), while some ID authors refused to speculate on the nature of the alleged designer. YEC authors utilized reinterpretation of scientific data as evidence for creation and to legitimize their belief in the historicity of Genesis. This could be regarded a form of scientism. YEC theodicy concentrated on the Fall as the cause of evil and the eschatological resolution of suffering. In contrast, ID proponents attempted to solve theodicy by compensated benefits of, e.g., pain. ID did not take a clear stand regarding salvation and ecclesiology, but YEC authors considered the acceptance of evolutionary theory and Christian faith to be mostly inconsistent. YEC doctrine differed from major Christian denominations by accepting scientific evidence as a proof for the historicity of Genesis and showed signs of exclusivity regarding evolutionary proponents. In ID, no satisfactory theodicy could be observed and some ID theorists could be classified as agnostics because of doubting the identity of the designer and by limiting God's omnipotence and benevolence. Both YEC and ID demonized evolutionary theory and its proponents. Creationism seems to be on its way to becoming a new kind of denomination or an emerging novel religion. © 2014 © 2014 Center for Theology and the Natural Sciences.","Agnosticism; Creationism; Evolution; Intelligent Design; Scientism; Theodicy",,"Scott, E.C., Antievolution and creationism in the United States (1997) Annual Review of Anthropology, 26, pp. 263-289; McGrath, A.E., (2010) Science & Religion: A New Introduction, pp. 17-42. , Chichester: Wiley-Blackwell; Scott, Antievolution and Creationism; Genesis, (2012) The AiG Statement of Faith, , http://www.answersinGenesis.org/about/faith, AiG.

It addresses the question of whether divine compositionalism is a species of occasionalism, treating occasional causation as a manifesting disposition which is analyzed in terms of God's creative action. We describe how divine compositionalism accounts for fundamental concepts in science including dispositions, causation, event, law of nature, and mechanism. We conclude that divine compositionalism is a more comprehensive view of divine creative action than concurrentism, and is distinct from extant views of occasionalism. © 2014 © 2014 Center for Theology and the Natural Sciences.","Causation; Disposition; Divine action; Mechanism; Occasionalism; Providence; Randomness",,"Francisco Suarez, S.J., (2002) On Creation, Conservation, and Concurrence: Metaphysical Disputations 20, 21, and 22, , South Bend, IN: St. Augustine's Press; Nadler, S., (2011) Occasionalism: Causation among the Cartesians, 34. , Oxford; Hebrews, 1, p. 3; Freddoso, A.J., Medieval aristotelianism and the case against secondary causation in nature (1988) Divine and Human Action: Essays in the Metaphysics of Theism, pp. 74-118. , ed.

It is argued that the prevailing natural attitude to the issue of the creation of the universe (whether based on Biblical hermeneutics or scientific theories) is philosophically inadequate because it does not account for the facticity of the articulating consciousness, which itself is the modality of the created. Correspondingly, the issue of creation receives a different interpretation: it is the coming into existence of personal life in the Divine image, capable of recognizing its createdness, and articulating creation as hypostatically distant from the comprehending subjectivity. Creation as inseparable from the life of subjectivity thus acquires the status of a saturated phenomenon to which neither successive quantitative, nor qualitative synthesis, nor temporal synthesis can be applied; it also escapes a rubric of relation. The created world, or the universe as a whole, gives itself to us from its own ""self"" to such an extent that it affects us, changes us and almost constitutes us, and stages us out of its own giving itself to us. The universe is present in the background of our existence through relationship and communion in such a way that we can express this presence ecstatically - through music, painting, poetry etc. - that presence which cannot be formalized in definitions of physics and mathematics. It is the living humanity that is the only and ultimate manifestation of God through its creation. © 2014 © 2014 Center for Theology and the Natural Sciences.","Aesthetic idea; Communion; Consciousness; Creation; Saturated phenomenon; Universe",,"Barth, K., (1936) Church Dogmatics, 3 (1), pp. ix. , Edinburgh: T. & T.

So far, the dominant focus has been the search for extraterrestrial life and intelligence. This paper broadens the discussion to include human life in outer space. Like religion, spaceflight has its prophets and evangelists, visions of utopia, transcendent experiences and promises of salvation. Spaceflight raises new questions for astrotheologians, in such areas as religious observance in space, ethics, and how spaceflight may influence traditional religions or give rise to new movements. Rather than ignoring links between religion and spaceflight, space scientists and advocates should seek to understand how religion influences human attitudes towards and activities in space. © 2014 Center for Theology and the Natural Sciences.","Astroculture; Astrofuturism; Astrotheology; Cosmism; Myth; Salvation; Transcendence; Utopia",,"Launius, R.D., Escaping Earth: Human Spaceflight as Religion (2013) Astropolitics: The International Journal of Space Politics & Policy, 11 (1-2), pp. 45-64; Geppert, A.C.T., Extraterrestrial encounters: UFOs, science, and the quest for transcendence, 1947-1972 (2012) History and Technology: An International Journal, 28 (3), pp. 335-362; Shlapentokh, D., The end of the Russian idea (1992) Studies in Soviet Thought, 43, pp. 199-217; Siddiqi, A.A., (2010) The Red Rocket's Glare: Spaceflight and the Soviet Imagination, , New York: Cambridge University Press; Harrison, A.A., Russian and American cosmism: Religion, national psyche, and spaceflight (2013) Astropolitics: The International Journal of Space Politics & Policy, 11 (1-2), pp. 25-44; Launius, Escaping Earth: Human Spaceflight As Religion, p. 6. , Ibid., 46; Peters, T., Astrotheology (2013) The Routledge Companion to Modern Christian Thought, , ed.

What role could shared CR play in the creative mutual interaction between science and theology? © 2013 Center for Theology and the Natural Sciences.","CERN; Critical realism; Higgs boson; LHC; Postmodern; Science and theology; Standard model",,"Townes, C.H., The convergence of science and religion (1966) Think, 32 (2), pp. 2-7. , http://www.templetonprize.org/pdfs/THINK.pdf, published by IBM, March-April, 4, accessed May 8, 2012; Whitehead, A.N., (1953) Science and the Modern World, p. 4. , Cambridge UK: Cambridge University Press, Whitehead's italics; Davies, P., (1992) The Mind of God: The Scientific Basis for A Rational World, p. 15. , New York: Simon and Schuster; Gilkey, L., (1970) Religion and the Scientific Future, p. 53. , New York: Harper; Barbour, I.G., (1966) Issues in Science and Religion, p. 172. , Englewood Cliffs NJ: Prentice Hall; Hawking, S., Mlodinow, L., (2010) The Grand Design, p. 7. , New York: Bantam Books; Barbour, I.G., (1990) Religion in An Age of Science Gifford Lectures 1989-1991, 1. , New York: Harper; Critical Realism, , http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Critical_realism, New World Encyclopedia; Delia Negra, M., Jenni, P., Virdee, T.S., Journey in the search for the higgs boson: The ATLAS and CMS experiments at the large hadron collider (2012) Science, 338 (6114), pp. 1560-1568. , December 21; (2012) ATLAS Collaboration in Physics Letter B, 716 (1), pp. 1-29. , September 17; http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.6436; Kane, G., (1995) The Particle Garden: Our Universe As Understood by Particle Physicists, pp. 53-70. , Boston: Addison-Wesley; Daniels, F., Alberty, R.A., (1961) Physical Chemistry, p. 4. , 2nd ed.

Starting with the transportation gap in London, we examine other gaps that may be illusory, along a spectrum, more serious/complex and almost defying resolution. By attending to these gaps, we can then better decide when and where dialog can occur with an appropriate action. Such collaboration, especially between neuroscience and theology, reveals the utility of a model depicting interaction/wholeness of the human brain/ mind/spirit in relationship to consciousness and with social implications for better health in a gapfilled society. © 2013 Center for Theology and the Natural Sciences.","Brain; Integrative medicine; Meditation; Myths; Philosophy; Psychology; Spirituality",,"(2011) Mind the Gap, , http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_the_gap, Google. 2011.

The progressive understanding of the spiritual dimension of human nature is just as important as the progressive understanding of the scientific nature of the universe. Krauss seems not to share a faith in theological matters which is not a reason on his part to belittle it.

Science, however, has progressively shown this perspective to be false, specifically through the discoveries that we are not at the universe's center, that the universe is much larger than we once thought, and that we evolved from ""lower"" life forms. While these discoveries are valid, the interpretation that they mortify vain human pretensions to significance is not.

Wilson's recent book, The Social Conquest of Earth, launches a new missile in the purported warfare between science and religion. The launching-pad is Wilson's embracing of group selection over kin selection to explain the evolutionary success of cooperation and even altruism in complex social groups. Rather than the selfish gene, groups of genetically diverse individuals who cooperate with one another drive evolution toward increased social organization, toward eusociality. Within the field of sociobiology, this is interesting. But Wilson does not stop here. He proceeds to engage in combat with all competing points of view, especially religious points of view. By relegating religion to a primitive stage of evolution and elevating science to an advanced stage, he provides justification for science to eliminate all its enemies and to establish hegemony in the worldview war. This article provides a critical analysis of Wilson's scientific method, especially his attempt to replace creation myths with his own scientized myths of origin. It concludes that Wilson need not do battle, because he could find among theologians allies in his understanding of human nature and his concern to make the world a better moral place. © 2013 Copyright Center for Theology and the Natural Sciences.","Creation myth; E.O.

Yet, there remains to be studied in more detail the notion of the philosophical foundations of the term. A prominent gap in our understanding of these foundations is the potential similarity between the metaphysics of Hegel and Whitehead, their understanding of the transcendence and immanence of God, and their respective versions of panentheism. In this article, I present a critical reflection on the possible resemblance between process thought and Hegelian metaphysics and philosophy of God. In the last section I refer to those who use panentheism within the science-theology dialogue. I try to specify which of the two versions of panentheism, that of Hegel or Whitehead, is more popular among those scholars. © 2013 Copyright Center for Theology and the Natural Sciences.","Hegel; Immanence; Panentheism; Transcendence; Whitehead",,"Cooper, J.W., (2006) Panentheism: The Other God of the Philosophers, , Grand Rapids MI: Baker Academic; Clayton God, P., (1997) Contemporary Science (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 94, p. 245; Clayton, P., Panentheism in Metaphysical and Scientific Perspective, pp. 79-81. , Whom We Live; Ward, K., The World As the Body of God, pp. 64-67. , Whom We Live; Ian, G., (1997) Barbour Religion and Science: Historical and Contemporary Issues, pp. 67-71. , New York: Harper Collins; John Russell, R., The theological-scientific vision of arthur peacocke (1991) Zygon, 26 (4), p. 512. , December; Ellis, R., From hegel to whitehead (1981) Journal of Religion, 61 (4), p. 403; Lowe, V., (1966) Understanding Whitehead, 257. , Baltimore MD: Johns Hopkins Press; North, W.A., (1948) Essays in Science and Philosophy, 10. , London: Rider & Co; Lucas, G.R., (1986) Hegel, Whitehead, and the Status of Systematic Philosophy, 3. , Hegel and Whitehead: Contemporary Perspectives on Systematic Philosophy, ed.

The first theme, desire, represents an ever greater love for God: an insatiability related to the limitations of human language. Such focused desire for God is likely associated with brain activity in the caudate nucleus (CN); associated permanent changes in the neuroplastic brain further enhance this desire. The second theme, discernment, is about listening to God, being open to God's graces, and waiting for the right time to make godly decisions. Such decisions reflect both cognitive and emotive skills, as verified by their overlapping neural circuits within the brain. Psychotherapy indicates that the mind can control the brain, consciously improving and directing chosen events, thus leading to enhanced discernment. The third theme is charity, which represents the universal link between love of God and love of neighbor. Neuroscience demonstrates how cognition gives rise to such features as willfulness, surrender, fragmentation and wholeness-all of which play significant roles in mystical experiences, including the evolution to charity. Love of neighbor can be taken as shared attention building on intersubjective perception; such shared attention represents a deep interaction of lovers in voluntary self-disclosure-surely the ultimate basis for charity. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Charity; Christian mysticism; Desire; Discernment; Mystical theology; Mysticism and science; Psychology",,"Cunningham, L.S., Nearer to God: Demystifying mysticism (2011) Commonweal, pp. 21-23. , October 7; Underhill, E., (1911) Mysticism: A Study of the Nature and Development of Man's Spiritual Consciousness, , London: Methuen; Greene, D., How buried talent leads to God (2011) The Tablet, pp. 12-13. , July 9; Christiansen, D., On the slope with teilhard (2010) America, pp. 13-16. , December 15; Thompson, A., (2012) O.P. at the Dominican School of Philosophy and Theology, , My descriptions of these five stages comes partially from a Medieval Mystics Seminar conducted by Berkeley, CA (Spring; Hollenback, J.B., (1996) Mysticism: Experience, Response and Empowerment, , University Park, PA: Pennsylvania State University Press; McGinn, B., Mystical consciousness: A modest proposal (2008) Spiritus: A Journal of Christian Spirituality, 16, pp. 44-63; Hollenback, J.B., This Definition of Mystical Experience Is A Conflation of Two Different Definitions Offered, , Mysticism, 120 and 130; Fagg, L.W., Are there intimations of divine transcendence in the physical world?

Nursi points out the ""problem of authoritarianism"" in both religious and secularist discourses, arguing that many of the clashes between faith and reason result from a misunderstanding of spheres of expertise. Nursi also argues that even at the height of scientific and technological development, the Qur'an remains indispensable in humankind interpreting the world around them.

Section 2 engages Gregersen's proposal critically in relation to traditional options within the Christian doctrine of the incarnation. If Gregersen's language of ""incarnation"" is to be taken seriously as a proposal that is grounded in but goes beyond traditional ideas, its best chance for success lies in being as clear as possible about relationship with its traditional sources.

That said, a second version of kenosis, one more consistent with Scripture and early patristic theology, meets Peters' criticism by presenting kenosis not as a creative withdrawal of divine power but as a self-negation on the part of God that results in the generation of created reality along with God's reappearance and presence in it, albeit in another form. This is the kenosis-plerosis model, one according to which God gives history its momentum and empowers finite beings as a consequence of God's own self-negation; this would make possible a way for Gregersen meaningfully to affirm God's action at higher levels of nature without violating nature's integrity, even though it does so in a heterodox way. © 2013 Center for Theology and the Natural Sciences.","Death of god; Divine intervention; Incarnation; Jürgen moltmann; Kenosis; Niels Gregersen; Plerosis; Power of god; Self-emptying; Ted Peters; Thomas altizer",,"Altizer, T., (1966) Gospel of Christian Atheism, p. 104. , London: Westminster; Friedman, R.E., (1995) The Disappearance of God: A Divine Mystery, p. 85. , Boston: Little, Brown and Company, The phrase ""narrative chronology"" belongs to Friedman; Oakman, D., The perennial relevance of Saint Paul: Paul's understanding of christ and a time of radical pluralism (2009) Biblical Theology Bulletin, 39 (1), pp. 120-131; Altizer, Gospel, p. 102","Peterson, D.J.; Matteo Ricci College, United States",,"Routledge",14746700,,,,"English","Theology Sci.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84894171193

On this background, it is discussed in which sense concepts of information and complexity may apply to theology proper. While the inherited axiom of divine simplicity forbids complexity and plurality as features of divine nature, an argument is developed for the presence of information and complexity in divine life. Three forms of information are proposed as relevant for a contemporary concept of God: Information as difference (Information1), information as form and relational structure (Information2) and semantic information (Information3). It is argued that features of these forms of information must be internal to divine life, if God can properly be said to facilitate and value the complex world of creation, to allow embodied creates to participate in divine life, and to communicate with creatures. In this light, the notion of divine simplicity will have to be redefined as the divine self-identity throughout temporal flux. © 2013 Center for Theology and the Natural Sciences.","Complexity theory; Differentiation; Divine identity; Doctrine of trinity; Information theory; Logos christology; Naturalism; Semantics",,"Cur deus caro: Jesus and the cosmos story (2013) Theology and Science, 11 (3), pp. 384-407. , The R.

The concept of deep incarnation offers a bridge by arguing that God's own Logos or Wisdom, when assuming the particular life story of Jesus, also conjoins the material conditions of God's world of creation at large (""all flesh""), shares the fate of all biological life forms (""grass and lilies""), and experiences the pains of all sentient creatures (""sparrows and foxes""). Incarnation is thus the story of God's reach into the very tissue of material and biological existence. In the embodied Logos, the ""flesh"" of Jesus Christ is co-extensive with his divinity.

Our argument shows that insights on this issue can be drawn from the current discussion in the cognitive science of religion (CSR).

This discussion engages three of McCauley's publications, which are analyzed with the purpose of assessing the appropriateness of this image.

Hence, the MNT is expected to be able to account for all kinds of empathic behavior. There is no need for analogical inference or theory of mind. To read another mind is to represent the perceptions, intentions, beliefs, expectations, and so on of the other. Due to mirror neuron activity, mindreading (and hence empathy) is automatic, immediate, unconscious and pre-reflective. I shall argue that mirror neuron activity may be sufficient to underpin primitive and involuntary types of empathic behavior but that mirror neurons are only to some extent involved in more developed, complex and consciousness related types of empathy such as what in the Jewish tradition is called doing mitzvah. Furthermore, I shall argue that in the process of mindreading the principle of analogical inference and the theory of mind cannot be entirely avoided. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Analogical inference; Empathy; Mindreading; Mirror neurons; Panentheism; Personhood; Representation; Resonance; Simulation; Theory of mind",,"Ramachandran, V.S., Mirror neurons and imitation learning as the driving force behind 'the great leap forward (2000) Human Evolution,'' EdgeVideo, Third Culture, , www.edge.org/3rd_culture/rama/rama_p1.html; Slack, G., (2007) I Feel Your Pain: New Proof of 'Mirror Neurons Explains Why We Experience the Grief and Joy of Others, and Maybe Why Humans Are Altruistic, , www.salon.com/news/feature/2007/11/05/mirror_neurons/print.html, But Don't Call us Gandhi Yet,'; (2008) Biological Altruism, , http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/altruism-biological/, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy; Jared, B.J., Milbank, (1990) Theology and Social Theory: Beyond Secular Reason, 33. , (Oxford Blackwell; Linda, T., Zagzebski, L.T., (2004) Divine Motivation Theory, 203. , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Heron, J., (2002) Feeling and Personhood (London SAGE, (1992), 1.

The first theme, detachment, minimizes any association with the secular world in favor of humility and openness to God. Detachment is chosen in consciousness using a resonant global workspace linked through the hippocampus to reconstructions of both declarative and emotional memory. The second theme, infused contemplation, is concerned with God's top-down revelation to the recollected mind of the mystic. The resulting top-down resonance creates an appropriate theory of mind for infused contemplation, as the human mind is now more perfectly linked with the mind of God. The third theme is mystical union, which both theology and science claim occurs within consciousness. Starting in intentional consciousness, the mystic undergoes an unmediated surrender beyond cognition to non-intentional consciousness. Because God fills the center of our being, a resonating luminosity can thus occur arising from the union of God and self within pure consciousness. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Christian mysticism; Detachment; Infused contemplation; Mystical theology; Mystical union; Mysticism and science; Phenomenology",,"Lawrence, S., Cunningham, Nearer to god: Demystifying mysticism (2011) Commonweal (October, 7, pp. 21-23; Underhill, E., (1911) Mysticism: A Study of the Nature and Development of Man's Spiritual Consciousness (London, , Methuen; Greene, D., How buried talent leads to god (2011) The Tablet (July, 9, pp. 12-13; Hitchcock, J., (1999) Healing Our Worldview: The Unity of Science and Spirituality, , West Chester, PA: Chrysalis Books; Christiansen, D., On the slope with teilhard (2010) America, 15, pp. 13-16. , December; Byron, J., (2008) Hollenback Mysticism: Experience Response and Empowerment, 16, pp. 44-63. , University Park PA: Pennsylvania State University Press, 1996) and Bernard McGinnMystical Consciousness: A Modest Proposal'' Spiritus A Journal of Christian Spirituality; This Definition of Mystical Experience Is A Conflation of Two Different Definitions Offered by Hollenback in Mysticism, 120 and 130; Fagg, W., Are there intimations of divine transcendence in the physical world?

The first theme, the spiritual senses, is modeled after the physical senses of seeing, hearing, smelling, touching and tasting. From a scientific viewpoint, the spiritual senses are like virtual senses which perceive through the mind rather than through the body. The second theme, the energies of God, can be expressed metaphorically through cross-domain mapping, wherein physical energy is the source domain and spiritual energy is the target domain. Physical energy is useful energy for work, whereas spiritual energy represents God's work in the natural world. The third theme, negation by apophasis, disavows both affirmation and denial, thus emphasizing that God is beyond all language. Affirmation and denial imply an unveiling and veiling, a process that occurs in both science and religion. Because of its simplicity and fecundity, this third theme can also be linked with science through considerations of beauty and elegance. © 2012 Taylor & Francis Group.","Christian mysticism; Energies of God; Epistemology; Mystical theology; Mysticism and science; Negation by apophasis; Spiritual senses",,"Cunningham, L.S., Nearer to god: Demystifying mysticism (2011) Commonweal, 7, pp. 21-23. , October; Underhill, E., (1911) Mysticism: A Study of the Nature and Development of Man's Spiritual Consciousness, , London: Methuen & Co; Greene, D., How buried talent leads to god (2011) The Tablet, 9, pp. 12-13. , July; Hitchcock, J., (1999) Healing Our Worldview: The Unity of Science and Spirituality, , West Chester, PA: Chrysalis Books; Christiansen, D., On the slope with teilhard (2010) America, 15, pp. 13-16. , December; Jones, C., Mysticism, human and divine (1986) The Study of Spirituality, pp. 17-24. , ed.

This is to propose that physics offers helpful metaphors in grasping perichoresis. Our major theological point is that light expresses the perichoretic union of God and humankind. We acknowledge that perichoresis also entails the interpenetration of Christ's two natures and the mutual indwelling of God, Son, and Holy Spirit, and these are, for us, supporting instances of perichoresis. After elaborating three light-related instances of perichoresis, we liken light's perichoretic nature, particularly as it finds expression in Albert Einstein's postulate of light speed constancy, to God's constant, unwavering love of humankind. © 2012 Taylor & Francis Group.","God's love; Light; Light cone; Light speed constancy; Perichoresis; Wave-particle duality",,"Oliver, D., Crisp, (2007) Divinity and Humanity, p. 4. , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Mowry Lacugna, C., (1991) God for Us: The Trinity and Christian Life, p. 228. , New York: HarperSanFrancisco; John, 17, pp. 20-21. , King James Version; Polkinghorne, J., The demise of democritus (2010) The Trinity and An Entangled World: Relationality in Physical Science and Theology, 1, p. 13. , ed.

This essay sketches the content of the statement and supports this claim in two ways. First, it exhibits the statement's theoretical underpinnings in demonstrating how the statement grows out of the fertile soil of recent decades' dialogue between science and theology. Second, it demonstrates how the statement synthesizes a moral imperative drawn from theological, ecclesial and philosophical elements for the ""public square"".

The search for global meaning has elicited responses from three areas of human thoughtnamely, myth, philosophy, and religion. In addition, today scientific knowledge claims to be a quest for global meaning and tries to offer its own view of the whole of physical reality and of its historical development. The question is then raised whether such a claim is legitimate. In itself, the scientific method is incapable of giving an exhaustive account of the whole of reality; nor does it grant entry to an all-encompassing meaning, due to the problems of the ontological and logical incompleteness necessarily associated with its formal, empirical language. However, any seeking after global meaning that seems to emerge in the scientific worldview should be understood as the subject's desire to know the whole, since the spiritual intellect of each scientist is naturally open to the universality and totality of being. Once the scientific enterprise is acknowledged as a human and personal activity, and its philosophical dimension better esteemed, the quest for global meaning set forth by the philosophical reflections of scientists can legitimately be understood as part of the natural human desire to know the whole, to know truth, and then as part of the human natural desire to know God. © 2012 Center for Theology and the Natural Sciences.","Aquinas; Human intellect; Humanistic dimension of science; Search for a global meaning; Ultimate questions",,"Aquinas, T., (1975) Summa Contra Gentiles, Book III, 3, p. 195. , ch. 59, trans Vernon J.

Here I argue that the most rhetorically compelling claim of New Atheism—that religion is at odds with the basic values of humanity—is also the point of their greatest philosophical deficiency. The second section addresses some of the scientific arguments that the New Atheists advance against supernatural theism. I argue that although such arguments never succeed in disproving the existence of God, they do succeed in rendering some conceptions of God implausible. © 2012, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

This study contends that Pannenberg's theology is important for our conception of the dialog between theology and science. However, I wish to offer a fundamentally new interpretation of Pannenberg which locates the ambiguous character of his methodology primarily in the substantive issue with which it deals. This redirects the dialogue between theology and science through Pannenberg's hermeneutic of history towards the contemporary phenomenology of the body and ultimately to the suggestion of a trinitarian-phenomenological approach beyond the methodology of Pannenberg. © 2012, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

To make this argument, Hauser focuses on the similarities between the acquisition of morality and the acquisition of language. Similar to language, one learns a particular moral framework from one's environment, but the biological components necessary for moral development are universal. While I agree with Hauser's overall conclusion regarding moral instincts, I reject the notion that a purely biological analysis of morality can provide an adequate framework for justification. The problem, as I see it, is Hauser acknowledges the bottom-up influences taking place between biology and moral formation, but he refuses to account for the top-down influences that occur between metaphysical assumptions, moral beliefs, and biological conclusions. Thus, the current critique will focus on the connection between Hauser's failure to account for top-down influence and the subsequent shortcoming related to moral justification. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Evolutionary psychology; Innate grammar; Language acquisition; Marc Hauser; Moral instincts; Moral judgments; Moral psychology; Reductionism; Top-down causation",,"Hauser, M., (2006) Moral Minds, , New York: Harper Collins; Chomsky, N., (1979) Language and Responsibility, , New York: Pantheon Publishing; Chomsky, N., (2006) Language and Mind, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Hauser Moral Minds, 76; Cushman, F., Hauser, M., Young, L., Reviving rawl's linguistic analogy: Operative principles and the causal structure of moral actions (2008) Moral Psychology, 2, pp. 171-173. , The Cognitive Science of Morality: Intuition and Diversity, ed.

We can move to a sense of the beholder's celestial ancestry and ongoing relatedness in our cosmic habitat. That account joins aesthetics with mathematics, finds dramatic interrelationships gathered under the anthropic principle, and considers meteorological aesthetics. The wonder is as much this Homo sapiens with mind enough to search the universe. What is out there is inseparably linked with what is down here. We are at home in the universe.

Noting a body of extant literature pertaining to the theme (Teilhard de Chardin, Tillich, Gunton, Moltmann, Fox, McFague, Edwards), this article argues that Martin Luther's ubiquity Christology should receive a fresh hearing in order to broaden and deepen the current discussion, in a way that can contribute both to kerygmatic and apologetic theological constructions. Concerns of critics of Luther's ubiquity Christology are addressed and its underdeveloped character is noted, with suggestions for expanding Luther's vision. At the end, the potential ecumenical benefits of this kind of reclamation of Luther's thought are affirmed, as is the need for kerygmatic theologians to develop not only cosmic christologies, but also cosmic pneumatologies. © 2011 Center for Theology and the Natural Sciences.","Cosmic christology; Cosmic pneumatology; Divine immanence; Divine transcendence; Kerygma; Paradox; The local presence of Christ; Theodicy; Ubiquity Christology",,"Sittler, J., Called to unity (1962) Ecumenical Review, 14, pp. 177-187. , January; Sittler, J., (2000) Evocations of Grace: Writings on Ecology, Theology, and Ethics, pp. 51-58. , Reprinted eds.

It identifies five key themes - the ontological status of mathematics; mathematics as a bridge to a noumenal world; God's relationship to the physical universe and how mathematics is part of this; truth - its nature, how we know it, certitude; and the role of mathematics in culture. The author develops these themes by exploring the thinking of several major historical figures. © 2011 Center for Theology and the Natural Sciences.","Culture; Mathematics; Noumenal reality; Ontology; Theology; Truth",,"Netz, R., The Pythagoreans (2005) Mathematics and the Divine: A Historical Study, pp. 77-97. , ed.

The concept of truth in mathematics with its relation to proof is discussed with regard to results in proof theory acquired by Gödel and Gentzen. The basic idea is that there is an interesting analogy between the way mathematical truth is sought in Gentzen's work and in apophatic theology. © 2011 Center for Theology and the Natural Sciences.","Levels of truth; Mathematics; Proof; Theology; Time; Truth",,"Michel, D., Ämät.

Points are a potential infinity, since there is no limit to the ability to produce them (say, by continually bisecting a line segment), but there is no actual infinity of points. Like most thinkers of his period, Walter Burley accepted this Aristotelian conception of the continuum, but he argued that God can and does see all of the points on a given line segment. One of the main founders of the contemporary conception of the continuum, Georg Cantor, invoked similar, but more far-reaching theological themes and arguments in his spirited articulation and defense of the actual infinite, ultimately yielding the contemporary conception that a line segment is, literally, composed of points. © 2011 Center for Theology and the Natural Sciences.","Actual infinite; Aristotle; Burley; Cantor; Continuity",,"White, M.J., (1992) The Continuous and the Discrete: Ancient Physical Theories from a Contemporary Perspective, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Kretzmann, N., (1982) Infinity and Continuity in Ancient and Medieval Thought, , Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press; Gerhart, C.I., (1863) Mathematische Scriften Von Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, p. 566. , Berlin: A.

This concept is found in almost all cultures. In mathematics, ""naming"" plays an essential role because mathematical objects that have not yet been named are difficult to work with. Many great mathematicians have placed emphasis on ""naming"" as the path toward gaining control over the objects they just conceived, including Alexander Grothendieck and Nikolai Luzin (the latter the founder of the Moscow School of Mathematics). Luzin's approach to naming mathematical objects was original: he believed that the act involved both gains and losses. On the one hand, he gained control through naming. On the other hand, he believed that he lost ""the foggy and dark parts that our intuition whispers to us."" Luzin was heavily influenced by the religious heresy ""Name- Worshipping"" in his development of Descriptive Set Theory. Name Worshippers believed that the name of God IS God. This influence has been largely missed by historians of mathematics because it has been condemned by two of the most powerful institutions in recent Russian history: the Orthodox Church and the Communist Party. © 2011 Center for Theology and the Natural Sciences.","Luzin; Moscow School of Mathematics; Name Worshippers; naming; set theory",,"Rothöhler, B., (2006) Neue Gedanken Zum Denkmal Memphitischer Theologie, , Heidelberg; An vielen Stellen gründet Osiris sein Ansprüche einfach auf seine Kenntnis der Namen der Götter (1881) Vorlesungen Über Ursprung and Entwicklung der Religion, Erläutert An der Religion der Alten Ägypter, p. 181. , P.L.

In this article, the author tries to consider some points which are related to the understanding of the Gödelian mode of the interaction between mathematics and philosophy. © 2011 Center for Theology and the Natural Sciences.","Concept; Foundations of mathematics; Gödel; Platonism; Set",,"Gödel, K., (2003) Collected Works, 4. , ed.

The by-product theory of religion argues that the explanation for religious beliefs can be reduced to a by-product of the unconscious processes of evolutionary cognitive adaptations. At the scientific level, the concept of emergence describes processes related to religious beliefs that are not causally reducible to cognitive adaptations. At the philosophical level, the by-product theory is often associated with certain metaphysical assumptions about the non-existence of supernatural beings, which is not warranted based on the empirical evidence alone. In general, evidence from the cognitive science of religion does not necessitate the elimination of theological explanations of religious beliefs and theology can act as a competing interpretative framework for the empirical findings at the levels of cognitive and evolutionary science. © 2010 Center for Theology and the Natural Sciences.","Cognitive science of religion; Emergence; Evolution and religion; New atheism; Reduction; Theology; Top-down causation",,"Ayala, F.J., Introduction (1974) Studies in the Philosophy of Biology: Reduction and Related Problems, , ed.

Certain popular interpretations of quantum physics have challenged conventional ways of thinking about time and space, being and becoming. Consequently, the traditional doctrine that God knows all things, including future contingent events, has recently come under debate. This paper explores how the way we think about time affects the way we think about God's relation to time. Theologians need to be careful when appropriating scientific theories in their theological reflections because interpretations of those theories often bring along unnecessary metaphysical presuppositions. Using an interpretation of special relativity that focuses on the Lorentz transformation, this paper shows that modern physics does not truly challenge the doctrine of divine foreknowledge. In fact, modern physical theories can actually deepen theological reflection on the classical doctrine of divine omniscience. © 2010 Center for Theology and the Natural Sciences.","Block universe; Contingency; Determinism; Einstein; Free will; Omnipotence; Omniscience; Special relativity; Time and eternity",,"Tanner, N., (1990) Decrees of the Ecumenical Councils, p. 806. , Washington, DC: Georgetown University Press; Burke, E.M., Omniscience (2003) New Catholic Encyclopedia 2nd Ed., p. 595. , Detroit: Gale; Aquinas, T., (1920) Summa Theologiae, , http://www.newadvent.org/summa, trans.

Key to this endeavor is an understanding of the relation of cognition and emotion in ethical decision-making, a relation that is usually understood to be oppositional but which in proper circumstances may be understood to be quite the opposite. Indeed, a distinctive feature of moral exemplarity may consist in the ability to properly integrate the emotions into the moral life, and reference to and imitation of exemplars may involve a referencing and imitating of the emotions of the exemplar. © 2010 Center for Theology and the Natural Sciences.","Agape; Brain; Emotion; Neuroeconomics; Neuroethics; Neuroscience; Virtue",,"Buckley, C., Man is rescued by stranger on subway tracks (2007) The New York Times, , http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/03/nyregion/03life.html, January 3; Mill, J.S., (1871) Utilitarianism, pp. 26-29. , London: Longmans, Green, Reader & Dyer; Waldstein, C., (1878) The Balance of Emotion and Intellect, p. 6. , London: C.

Beyond the first wave, which may largely be characterized as opponents to evolution ignoring the subject with the hope that it would simply go away, the next three creationist waves (prohibiting the teaching of human evolution; requiring the teaching of creation science; requiring the teaching of intelligent design) were all defeated because courts regularly ruled the legislative actions taken to promote each wave unconstitutional. While the fifth wave, a call for the weaknesses of evolution to be taught, shares many of the same motives with earlier waves, the major difference is that legislation is being crafted in a manner that makes it likely the courts will not be able to intercede. Thus, if a robust view of religion and a healthy understanding of science are to be promoted, combating this new wave of creationism will require different strategies than have previously been in place. One such strategy is for religious leaders and scientists to join forces and demonstrate to the public that those promoting conflict are in the minority and doing damage to both religion and science. © 2010 Center for Theology and the Natural Sciences.","Creationism; Evolution; Intelligent Design; Religion and science",,"Gould, S.J., Darwin's more stately mansion (1999) Science, 284, p. 2087; Larson, E.J., (1985) Trial and Error: The American Controversy over Creation and Evolution, , New York: Oxford University Press; Levine, L.W., (1965) Defender of the Faith: William Jennings Bryan: The Last Decade 1915-1925, , New York: Oxford University Press; (1968), http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/epperson-v-arkansas.html, Epperson v.

Recently, Ted Peters argued that, despite reassurances to the contrary, religion and myth are the bases for these scientific speculations. Whereas it is not possible to disprove his thesis, there are alternative paths to such optimism. The longer a civilization persists, the more likely it will overlap our civilization in time and thus be detected by us. Over the centuries, terrestrial societies have become more inclusive, more democratic, more peaceful, and more altruistic, and I propose that these trends reflect deep natural processes that would affect all societies everywhere. Societies following these trends endure, while those that rely on threat and coercion shine but a brief moment in historical time. Although religious response would be varied, the best available evidence refutes the claim that the discovery of extraterrestrial intelligence would constitute a triumph of science over religion. Theologians and religious leaders help with the search by broadening and deepening the discussion, engaging the public, strengthening our sense of humanity, and fostering hope. © 2010 Center for Theology and the Natural Sciences.","Astrobiology; Contact Planning Group; ETI; Evolution",,"Morrison, D., Overview of astrobiology (2001) Workshop on the Societal Implications of Astrobiology Final Report, p. 12. , http:www/http://astrobiology.arc.nasa.gov/workshops/societal/ societal_report.pdf, Albert A.

The author then goes on to examine Ayala’s understanding of the relationship between science and religion. Finally, the author asks critical questions about Ayala's contributions to the theodicy problem and the critique of Intelligent Design. © 2009, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

When assumptions within the field of astrobiology are examined, we find that the Darwinian model of evolutionary development is imaginatively projected onto extrasolar planets; and this model includes a built-in doctrine of progress. The assumption of progress within evolution permits astrobiologists to look forward to contact with an extraterrestrial civilization that is more intelligent and more advanced than that on earth. Such an extraterrestrial civilization will allegedly have an advanced science that can save earth from its primitive and under-evolved propensity for violence. However, no empirical evidence for a more highly evolved or advanced civilization currently exists, despite these beliefs. The theologian labels the constellation of scientific assumptions here the “ETI myth.” Astrotheology celebrates hard-nosed empirical science and even encourages space exploration; but the mythical assumptions regarding the doctrine of progress within evolution are here given critical analysis. © 2009, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Francisco J. Ayala seeks to negotiate a truce between the opposing sides through implementing the concept of the Non-overlapping Magisteria (NOMA) of science and theology. The NOMA understanding of the interaction between science and religion maintains that science and religion cannot contradict each other because each discipline has its own proper range of inquiry, namely questions of fact versus questions of value. This article explores the boundaries of these two different domains of knowledge and finds that in both theory and practice, the territorial claims overlap significantly. Furthermore, the author argues that such “territorial trespassing” is not owing to misunderstandings concerning the essence of science and of religion as such. Instead, the overlap of boundary lines—when viewed in light of the history and philosophy of science—is understood as integral to how progressive research normally advances in both science and theology. © 2009, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

In The Origin of Species (1859), Darwin advanced a scientific explanation of the design of organisms: evolution by natural selection. Organisms are pervaded by imperfections, dysfunctions, cruelties, and even sadism. The theory of evolution accounts for these mishaps, by natural selection, so that they need not be attributed to God’s explicit design.

Physics has firmly established that the universe is moving towards increasing entropy, whereby the cosmos is in a state of decay and growing disorder. At the same time, traditional theology has perceived that the world is in a state of chaos, resulting from the sin of Adam and Eve. While these notions have a number of significant similarities, the causal explanation for both theories poses a problem for any correlation between the two. Theology has struggled to explain how human action produced entropic phenomena without enacting anachronistic explanations that discount scientific data. This paper intends to close the gap by positing the principle of entropy as an existential dynamic of the Fall, thus reasserting the universality of original sin and evading the narrowness of anthropocentrism. Paul Tillich's interpretation of the Fall provides important insights that can affirm the corrosion of the world from a scientific and a theological perspective, potentially bringing these two disciplines into a position for a more fruitful dialogue. © 2009, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

By retrieving some aspects of Aristotle's philosophy of hylomorphism, we may better understand the metaphysical grounding of human wholeness and so develop an integrated account of the human person, including mind and brain. © 2009, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

For any perfection, we use transfinite recursion to define an endlessly ascending series of degrees of that perfection. That series rises to an absolutely infinite degree of that perfection.

These concern the metaphysical foundations of science and religion (science and spirituality, science and theology) with a specific emphasis on epistemology, ontology, anthropology, aims, methodological procedures, limitations of binary logic, and the use of other types of logic (in particular relational and contextual reasoning). Dialogues between science and religion can have positive practical societal relevance, and therefore need to progress faster. An enlargement of humanity’s mental horizons and development—especially of epistemic cognition—seems to be called for in order to secure the future of a global intellectual culture.

The article reviews its different uses in German, American, and British philosophy and examines its relation to Barbour's introduction of the term in the science and theology debate. The result is that there is a close connection to scientific realism, but not to philosophical critical realism in a narrower sense. Critical realism is a type of realism defining the term in Kant's sense as related to the question of the existence of the tempospatial world. It distinguishes itself as a middle way between naïve realism and other extremes. © 2009, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

These relate to the origins of science and assume that, once established, modern science becomes self-justifying. However, seventeenth-century criticisms of science—attacks on the Royal Society being one example—suggest that science remained a marginal and precarious activity for some time. The rise of science to cultural prominence in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries was possible only because science was eventually able to establish itself as a religiously useful enterprise. Religion thus played a key role not only in the origins of modern science, but in providing the ongoing social sanctions that ensured its persistence and rise to prominence. © 2008, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

It turns out that these three theories can be brought into correlation. On the one hand, in the framework of Kuhn’s theory, three kinds of scientific revolutions can be distinguished, which, together with normal science, correspond to Barbour’s four ways that science and religion relate to each other. On the other hand, Lindbeck’s three views on the nature of doctrine can be complemented by a fourth view, and so brought into correspondence with Barbour’s theory. This fourth view understands doctrines as forms of transcendence. We will analyze the theological motifs in the works of Galileo, Descartes, and Newton and show how the scientific revolution relates to the integration of science and religion in Barbour’s sense. © 2008, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

In this article, the author argues in favor of the fruitfulness of the reverse perspective. It is suggested that the experience and expertise that theologians have accumulated in the field of hermeneutics is an asset for scientists. The critical engagement with the art of interpreting and understanding is necessitated by both the potential of scientific concepts to build ideology and the role that metaphoric processes play, not only in the communication of science to non-scientists but also in scientific research and teaching. Questions of trust—crucial for science and scientists—call for a reflection that, in addition to philosophical hermeneutics, includes theological hermeneutics. This task is explicated in terms of the prophetic role of theology, which offers an alternative to worldviews that build on a dualism between the natural and the supernatural. © 2008, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The first is the problem of purpose: can evolutionary processes, in which chance plays so prominent a role, be understood as the context of God’s purposive action? The second is the problem of the pervasiveness of suffering and death in evolution. To the extent that we succeed in responding to the first difficulty by giving an account of how God’s purposes are enacted in the history of life, we deepen the conundrum about God’s relation to natural evils. In particular, if we embrace evolution as God’s clever way of making life make itself, we will find it difficult to sustain the classical theological claim that death is a disruptive interloper in God’s good creation. © 2008, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Given this capacity, I argue that first we need to reflect more carefully on human sin and evil in evolutionary terms. Second, I question the adequacy of the traditional divide between “moral” and “natural” evil as well as consider the possibility of anthropogenic evil. Third, I suggest that a theological response to nonhuman morality should include discussion of the atonement, but traditional categories prove inadequate. Fourth, drawing on Sergii Bulgakov, I explore the idea of shadow sophia as representing a multivocal theodicy that is capable of holding together a tapestry of different theological responses to evil. Finally, I discuss the redemption of nature in the light of the foregoing discussion. © 2008, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

These theologians are thinking of classical Newtonian science; I argue that in fact classical science is in no way incompatible with specialdivine action, including miracle. What is incompatible withspecial divine action is the Laplacean picture, which involves the causal closure of the universe. I then note that contemporary, quantum mechanical science doesn’t even initially appear to be incompatible with special divine action. Nevertheless, many who are well aware of the quantum mechanical revolution (including some members of the SpecialDivineAction Project) still find a problem with special divine action, hoping to find an understanding of it that doesn’t involve divine intervention. I argue that their objections tointervention are not sound. Furthermore, it isn’t even possible to say what intervention is, giventhe quantum mechanical framework. I conclude by offering anaccount of specialdivine action that isn’t open to their objections to intervention. © 2008, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

As the scientific search for evidence of microbial life on Mars intensifies, there has been a perceived need to examine the theological implications in advance of such a possible discovery. Religious considerations, thus far, have focused mainly on Western Christianity as represented by the Roman Catholic and various Protestant traditions. Although Eastern Orthodoxy represents the second largest group of Christians worldwide, to date, there is very little information available from these ongoing discussions concerning an Eastern Orthodox perspective. Therefore, we first review the case for the possibility of microbial life on Mars and then explore its fundamental Orthodox theological meaning. The apprehension of any form of extraterrestrial life by the Orthodox Church will be rooted in its collective interpretationof the Holy Scriptures, Patristic and contemporary religious writers, and in the ancient liturgical expression of its worship. © 2008, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Then a descriptive definition of “spirit” is advanced along with the concluding standpoint that while “spirit” is vague, even poetic, it remains for the foreseeable future a necessary and useful placeholder for what advances in neuroscience and future philosophical and theological research can help us unveil further. © 2007, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Drawing on the fields of non-equilibrium thermodynamics and citing Darwin's own observations, the author proposes a new understanding of form that corresponds to the dynamism present in living forms and overcomes the limitations of other metaphysical notions of form. Form as beautiful “dynamic form” promises an enriched empiricism, which not only can speak “correctly” about nature but also “well” of nature. In other words, an enriched empiricism of beautiful dynamic forms allows for a fruitful dialogue between science and theology. It avoids theological explanations that call for special divine intervention in the world of Nature which threaten the dignity and self-integrity of Creation. It opens up a view, however, of a divine “milieu,” a divine “Openness,” that providentially calls for beautiful dynamic forms to emerge and entangle through the evolutionary process of nature. © 2007, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

It constrains religion to the question of theism and atheism and compromises the character of a scientific theory by suggesting that a theory or the natural process it describes can be theistic or atheistic. By doing so, the term “theistic evolution” is counterproductive to the grand vision that Peters and Hewlett want to pursue. It also misses the point that anti-evolutionism is about anthropology and morality more than about theism. Appraisals of secular culture, contemporary theology, and current biology, as presented in this article, point beyond ‘theistic evolution’. Instead, I argue for the use of “theology of evolution”. © 2007, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The spectrum of evangelical-theological approaches to evolution, natural history, and origins-of-life issues are presented in these texts, as are evangelical-theological perspectives on the Intelligent Design phenomenon, on theological and scientific method, and on the philosophy of science. Summary observations about the status quaestiones of the theology-and-science discussion in the evangelical world at the beginning of the twenty-first century are provided, and future developments anticipated among conservative Protestants in their engagements with the sciences. © 2007, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Evolution constitutes the milieu in which we live, and this milieu is ultimately a divine milieu, the work of God. The following arguments elaborate this proposal: (1) we must place our efforts to give a theological appraisal of evolution within the classical theological context of apophasis and cataphasis. (2) The scientific study of evolution is religiously and theologically important because it throws light on the works of God (God's economy). (3) The divine energies are a realm of hiddenness, embedded in paradox.

Religion seems to imply that there is a qualitative distinction between human beings and the rest of creation; however, there is a strong tradition in Christianity and in Eastern thought that suggests that the natural world also has a relationship with God. Human dominion over other parts of creation exists, but does not obviate this connection, nor give humans a circle unto themselves. The concept of humans being created in the image of God can be used to explain why we might believe humans are in a circle unto themselves, yet we can expand this concept to include artificially intelligent computers, a new potential member of the cognitive family. Our quest for artificial intelligence tells us both what we value in our humanity, and how we might extend that valuation to the rest of creation. © 2007, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

When the tension between creationism and evolution is examined in light of what well known medieval theologians wrote, it appears that the current debates related to evolution often lapse into the fallacy of equivocation. One unfortunate consequence of this breakdown is that the root of the problem, the subtle language involved, often remains unexposed. Moreover, the level of passionate discourse surrounding evolution suggests that a nearly scholastic approach is required if further confusion is to be limited. © 2007, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The ideal, abstract entities of mathematics do not fit readily within a materialist world. Truth, logic, and mathematics require the existence of universal norms. However, materialism has no place for abstract entities or universal norms. How can such ideal norms, inert in themselves, influence our minds? The indispensability of mathematics to physics is a strong argument for realism. Theism posits that God upholds mathematical truths, which reside in the divine mind. Classical mathematics presumes the existence of an Ideal Mathematician—an all-powerful, all-knowing and infinite God. Since theism holds that man is created in God’s image and that God can communicate truth to us, humans may be expected to have access to mathematical knowledge. Since God has created the world according to a rational plan, the world may be expected to have a mathematical structure. © 2007, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Al-Ghazālī reframed the necessity (al-darūra) of causal relationships in nature in order to achieve two goals: one, theological and the other, epistemological. His intellectual solution ultimately preserved both the human ability to know material causal relations as well as divine creative omnipotence, in particular, God’s ability to perform miracles. The Muslim discussion thus indirectly contributed to Western speculative thinking on this problem. The balanced approach that al-Ghazālī took, nevertheless, fell by the wayside within the Islamic environment where it was either ignored, or only partially understood, or narrowly and imperfectly interpreted. In the purely Muslim context, it also is essential to underscore the importance of al-Ghazālī’s epistemological discoveries in laying the groundwork for the establishment of a paradigm of natural scientific speculation in the medieval Islamic world. © 2007, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The Franciscan theology of Bonaventure and Scotus is used to explore “exoChristology” by examining the Incarnation as a theological rather than anthropological event. The primacy of Christ, held by Franciscan theologians, provides an integral relationship between Christ and creation. From this relationship, it is shown that Incarnation takes place wherever there is intelligible life. It is suggested that all possible worlds, created through the Word of God, bear a spiritual potency within them and are open to spiritual transformation. The divine Word is incarnate in every created order through the appropriate form of intelligible life within that order and completes that order through love. Because Incarnation may take on other extraterrestrial life forms, it is suggested that there may be multiple incarnations but only one Christ. © 2007, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Using concepts of “variety” and algorithmic informational complexity, Leibniz' claim can be reframed as a testable theory. This theory predicts that the laws and conditions of the actual universe should be simpler, and the universe richer in phenomena, than the presence of observers would require. Tegmark has shown that inhabitants of an infinite multiverse would likely observe simple laws and conditions, but also phenomenal richness just great enough to explain their existence. Empirical observations fit the claim of divine choice better than the claim of an infinite multiverse. The future of the universe, including its future information-processing capacity, is predicted to be endless. © 2006, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

On the one hand, the sciences suggest nature’s self-sufficiency as a closed and coherent system; on the other, they hint at what we may credibly view as a transcendent source for nature. The idea of a transcendent source does not negate science, but it does undercut claims on behalf of science’s self-sufficiency. As a naturalist and exemplary experimentalist, Robert Boyle retained the highest respect for natural order. Boyle’s unrelenting naturalism, however, left his belief in God untouched, whereas the more radical naturalism of our day rings forth from pulpits and the pens of theologians. There is no place within science for purely empirical proofs of the existence of God or God’s purposes within evolutionary history. Nevertheless, it is fascinating to reflect philosophically and theologically on the biological data and what they might portend. I take my lead from emergence theory, the study of emergent complexity in natural history. © 2006, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

By comparing the goals and practice of robotics and artificial intelligence in the US and Japan, differences between the two countries can be traced to their religious environments. Christian expectations of cosmic purpose and hope for salvation in purified, unearthly bodies leads to US researchers’ preference for artificial intelligence over humanoid robots, a desire to see cosmic meaning in the development of that intelligence, and salvation of human minds in virtual, non-biological bodies. In Japan, robots, which have been the subjects of ritual consecrations and religious transcendence, participate in a fundamental sanctity of the natural world. A positive outlook on being human promotes a preference for humanoid robots and a future in which robots serve human beings, who do not forsake their bodies for virtual lives. Divergent scientific strategies cannot be separated from the religious worlds of their practitioners. © 2006, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Such entanglement would entail non-local, relational holism and superposition through which the immanent unity of the Trinity is economically present in creation. Christ kenoticly empties himself of the immanent perichoresis of the Trinity in order to enter the economic perichoresis of the creation. The Spirit is then the continuing perichoretic love of God sanctifying the creation toward life and fulfillment from within. It is the Trinity in ongoing perichoretic entanglement with the creation, affirming Divine ubiquity and panentheism. © 2006, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Finally, what if there exists something like a Fourth Thermodynamic Law of self-organization, which more or less guarantees a general trend towards biological complexity? What would all this mean for an exposition of a Christian theology, informed and constrained by scientific findings?. © 2006, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Until now, the dialogue between science and religion has mainly been a dialogue within the Abrahamic faith traditions, but in the spirit of true dialogue, it should also extend to worldviews from other cultures. Scientism has one of its strongest footholds in China and has dominated Chinese intellectual culture for nearly a century. In fact, science and technology still rule supreme today. An atheistic communist rule, together with a humanistic Confucianist tradition that leaves little room for religious values, has suppressed religion in China for a long while. The introduction of science and religion dialogue will inevitably help Chinese scholars reflect upon the development of science and technology in China, and in the process, rediscover China's religious heritage and gain new grounds in its scientific and religious life.

I will refer to this intertwinement by using the word “onto-theology,” i.e. a metaphysical system that is mainly derived from some fundamental theological assumptions. I will present the constituents of Newton’s onto-theology. One important, but often neglected stratum of Newton’s metaphysics is the “secularization of God.” Newton, then, was not only a reformer in science, he also was a defender of a more rationalized, i.e. secularized, conception of God. As we will see, God and all other existing entities exist on the same ontological level. Newtonian metaphysics can thus be seen as the expression of how religious attitudes adapted themselves to or secularized themselves in a world of growing complexity wherein the scientific outlook became more and more central. This analysis has implications for the secularization-debate. It will be argued that the secularization-process not only involved differentiating tendencies between the profane and the secular (as is widely accepted by the differentiation-thesis), but that unifying tendencies (exemplified by Newton’s unified onto-theology) were equally important. © 2006, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Two paradigms for understanding the nature of human knowledge are considered in relation to quantum mechanics: the subjective-observing perspective of Kant, and the objective-participant perspective of Thomas Aquinas. I discuss whether quantum mechanics necessarily implies a subject centered perspective on reality, and argue, with reference to d'Espagnat’s notion of veiled reality, that quantum non-separability challenges this view. I then explore whether the objective-participant perspective of Thomas Aquinas provides a more fruitful context for understanding quantum mechanics. I discuss quantum measurement in terms of the transition from potentiality to actuality, and knowledge as the latent intelligibility of the world realized. However, the negative nature of our knowledge of quantum non-separability also challenges this perspective. Our theological thinking in response to quantum knowledge must therefore proceed tentatively, balancing a via positiva, with a via negativa. © 2006, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Yet mathematics also plays a less-recognized religious role in that metaphors drawn from mathematics (mathaphors) can influence our spiritual perspectives by helping us to entertain new religious ideas and to challenge old ones. Mathaphors are therefore useful tools in matheology (the study of mathematics and theology). This essay explores ten ways in which contemporary mathaphors affect our spiritual lives. Specifically, mathaphors are: changing our metaphors for God; challenging our human role in the universe; helping us accept ambiguity; revamping our understanding of the one and the many; revising our thoughts about free will and determinism; moving us toward pluralistic, multi-world views; pushing the envelope on what consciousness is; altering our expectations for afterlife; offering the hope of a more compassionate future; encouraging faith perspectives that are always incomplete and in process. © 2006, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

My ‘bottom line’ is twofold. First, Cardinal Schönborn’s concern over evolution is unnecessary: What scientists view as chance in nature Christians can see as God’s ongoing and purposeful action in the creation of life and humanity. Second, the Cardinal’s concern is also misplaced. When evolutionary theory is co-opted by atheists to serve their agenda the Cardinal should challenge the atheists, not the science they falsely claim proves their views. © 2006, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik (1903 – 1993) served as the Rosh Yeshiva (Senior Talmudic Scholar) of the Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary, and Professor of Philosophy at Yeshiva University for almost 50 years. He was widely acknowledged, by all segments of the Jewish community, as the outstanding Talmudic scholar of his generation. At the same time, concern for the interface of tradition with modernity was central and pivotal to Soloveitchik’s thought. In spite of his profound impact on American Orthodox Judaism, Soloveitchik’s work is relatively unknown outside of this community. This article explores the implications of Soloveitchik’s work for epistemology and methodology within the “science and religion” dialogue. © 2005, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

They argue that Christians or Muslims should respond by developing their own kind of science, an “Islamic science,” a “sacred science,” a “theistic science” or a “faith-informed science.” In this article the recent writings of two advocates of such a view, standing in two different religious traditions, namely Mehdi Golshani (Islam) and Alvin Plantinga (Christianity) are compared, analyzed, and evaluated. A distinction between different ways in which religion might enter into the fabric of science is introduced and it is argued that the most crucial issues surround the question of whether or not religion ought to play a part in the validation of theories. © 2005, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

An analysis of its origin and meaning leads to the question if this position mostly propagated by physicist-theologians could miss an intrinsic feature of the personal dimension of reality. A deeper meaning of the personal dimension sets human science apart. Taking into account social science's insight that persons responsible for their conclusions and actions drive the process of science, the moral dimension of science has to be emphasized. To integrate these aspects into a coherent position, a more differentiated epistemological model is needed. The solution proposed in this paper is to modify critical realism to constructive-critical realism. Theologically interpreted, constructive-critical realism remembers humankind’s purpose to shape nature in cooperation with God and with the means of culture toward increasing realization of freedom in relationship. The argument is widely influenced by an analysis of the works of John Polkinghorne. © 2005, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

In this paper, several critical boundary areas between humans and animals are examined for scientific evidence about human distinctiveness. These include communication and language capacity, cultural creativity, spirituality, and ethical capacity. Chimpanzee language studies and research in Neanderthal mentality are examined as the closest known natural approximations to human communication and intelligence. The implications of the findings are explored in relation to human culture, ethics, and spirituality in a context consistent with evolutionary continuity. Aspects of human uniqueness are apparent, can be fruitfully encompassed in the idea of personhood, and are coherent with Trinitarian theology’s anthropological focus. © 2005, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

For Augustine the ideal would be to see nature as God sees it, feeling deeply both its beauty and its impermanence, loving nature without clinging to it. With such clear seeing would come love and the motivation for sustained and skillful action.

This raises the interesting ontological question of the true nature of reality. Western science as seen in its evolution from Socratic Greece has tried to understand the world by “objectifying” it, resulting in dualistic dilemmas. Indian “Science,” as seen in its evolution from the Vedic times (1500—500 BCE) has tried to understand the world by “subjectifying” our consciousness of reality. Within the Hindu tradition, the Advaita-Vedanta school of philosophy offers possibilities for resolving not only the Cartesian dilemma but also a solution to the nature of difference in a non-dualistic totality. We also present the Advaita-Vedanta principle of superimposition as a useful approach to modern physical and social science, which have been increasingly forced to reject the absolute reductionism and dualism of classical differences between subject and object. © 2005, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Following a brief summary of bridging issues between psychology and theology, Benson's recent cultural psychology framework is outlined. Its relevance for theology is considered under three headings: incarnational categories, self-knowing and God-knowing, and theological method. The essay concludes with a short reflection on the self in Eucharistic space, and the limits of cultural psychological accounts. © 2005, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Focusing on Nancey Murphy, this paper argues that non-reductive physicalism has an inadequate conception of causality. Murphy defends downward causation, but like many modern and postmodern philosophers, she pays insufficient attention to the metaphysics of causality. Drawing on Thomistic philosophy, this article maintains that lower-level entities like neurotransmitters lack the causal power necessary to produce higher-level cognitive operations. In defending emergence, Murphy performs a metaphysical sleight-of-hand through which cognitive powers inexplicably appear. The paper ends by urging contemporary thinkers to develop richer metaphysical understandings of causality, and to use them to enhance the dialogue between religion and science. © 2004, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

There are four popular viewpoints in this debate, namely Platonism, formalism, intuitionism, and logicism. A natural question that arises is whether belief in one of these viewpoints affects the mathematician’s research? In particular, does subscribing to a Platonist or a formalist viewpoint influence how a mathematician conducts research? Does the area of research influence a mathematician’s beliefs on the nature of mathematics? How are the beliefs regarding the nature of mathematics connected to theological beliefs? In order to investigate these questions, five professional research mathematicians were interviewed. The mathematicians worked in diverse areas within analysis, algebra, and within applied mathematics, and had a combined 160 years of research experience. Although none of the mathematicians wanted to be pigeonholed into any one category of beliefs, the study revealed that four of the mathematicians leaned towards Platonism, which runs contrary to the popular notion that Platonism is an exception today. This study revealed that beliefs regarding the nature of mathematics influenced how mathematicians’ conducted research and were deeply connected to their theological beliefs. The findings are presented in the form of vignettes that give an insight into the mathematical and theological belief structures of the mathematicians. © 2004, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Her argument intersects with recent concerns in moral psychology that theory should be constrained by the lives of ordinary people, an idea known as psychological realism. This article considers limitations for altruistic self-renunciation through research with L’Arche assistants for the developmentally disabled. Incipient, “natural” character is evident through the ambivalence of these everyday altruists, creating a difficult methodological challenge for the psychological realist. Consequently, a novel approach for the mathematical analysis of subject narrative is explored with the use of a powerful computational linguistics program. © 2004, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Al-Ghazali denies causal necessity that links cause and effect since this relationship does not draw on logical rules that make it necessary. This, however, does not mean that he denies the existence of a causal relationship between things, as he recognizes its existence. He, however, denies the necessity of that relationship, as he claims that the source of causal necessity stems from a psychological emotion rather than from being inherent in things themselves. Al-Ghazali also attempts to base causal necessity on “habit” by claiming that the similarity of event A as cause and event B as effect stems from observation, repetition and the sequencing of natural phenomena. Al-Ghazali, then, endeavors to prove that science is based on expectation and assumption that draws on observation, the senses, and repetition and does not consider it as constant and absolute. © 2004, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Scientific naturalism emerged again in the 18th and 19th centuries, but because of ideas retained from the supernaturalistic mechanism that became associated with science in the 17th century, naturalism appeared in a distorted version, one that is inadequate for science itself as well as incompatible with Christian faith or any other significantly religious view.

The claims of William Dembski and of Michael Behe are unscientific because they are a-theoretic. The argument from order or from utility are shown to be indeterminate, circular, to rest on psychological as opposed to factual certainty, or to be insupportable as regards humans but possibly not bacteria, respectively. The argument from the special intelligibility of the universe specifically to human science does not survive comparison with the capacities of other organisms. Finally, the argument from the unlikelihood of physical constants is vitiated by modern cosmogonic theory and recrudesces the God-of-the-gaps. © 2004, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The author contends that this approach to time and eternity might solve the logical tension between the classical notion of divine sovereignty and the common sense belief in creaturely spontaneity/human freedom. For, if the existence of the events constituting a temporal sequence is primarily due to the spontaneous decisions of creatures, and if their being ordered into a totality or meaningful whole is primarily due to the superordinate activity of God, then both God and creatures play indispensable but nevertheless distinct roles in the cosmic process. © 2004, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

We attempt to construct the coherence of our awareness through our science, and we attempt to render it meaningful in our thoughts and language. Metaphor and symbol are primary vehicles for our attempts at meaning. Since its task is to articulate meaning, theology must acknowledge this premise, if it is to engage the sciences adequately. © 2003, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The complex structure of the human eye evinces that it was designed by an intelligent Creator. The argument is based on the irreducible complexity (“relation”) of multiple interacting parts, all necessary for function. Paley adduces a wealth of biological examples leading to the same conclusion; his knowledge of the biology of his time was profound and extensive. Charles Darwin’s Origin of Species is an extended argument demonstrating that the “design” of organisms can be explained by natural selection. Moreover, the dysfunctions, defects, waste, and cruelty that prevail in the living world are incompatible with a benevolent and omnipotent Creator. They come about by a process that incorporates chance and necessity, mutation and natural selection. In addition to science, there are other ways of knowing, such as art, literature, philosophy, and religion.

Although religious spokespersons agree nearly universally that human reproductive cloning should be banned; moral ambivalence rises when confronting human embryonic stem cell research. Rather than focus on beneficence (medical benefits), religious bioethicists focus on nonmalificence (embryo protection). The Vatican claim that stem cell research should be banned because it destroys embryos appears at first to rely upon ensoulment at conception; but a closer analysis shows that the Vatican position relies upon genetic uniqueness. Appeal to genetic uniqueness is inadequate for Christian anthropology; what needs to be added is a relational and proleptic understanding of human dignity. © 2003, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Primate studies demonstrate genetic and evolutionary connections between humans and chimpanzees, and chimpanzee studies observe forms or precursors of culture, learning, symbolic communication, tool use, language abilities, social economy, aesthetics, morality, and spirituality. Recognition of chimpanzee abilities requires philosophy and theology to reconsider concepts of nature-culture dualism, continuity and discontinuity, comparability and analogy, personhood, and morality and sin. How chimpanzees are distinguished from humans has implications for justice toward animals, women, and persons of color. © 2003, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

S. Lewis, take their definition of naturalism to mean rejection of the supernatural (and with it, theism). A better definition of contemporary naturalism is proposed: naturalism thinks in terms of reality as understood by the sciences, and the natural is composed of systems demarcated from the rest of the world; those systems have states, and a state is an unambiguous function of time. Naturalism abstracts these from all other features of the things it knows. Action is interpreted as an efficient cause making a change in the trajectory of a natural system. Methodological naturalism merely applies these definitions to this world for purposes of science. Comprehensive naturalism insists that all things whatsoever are exhaustively intelligible on naturalistic terms. Dualistic naturalism (commonly known as supernaturalism) would locate naturalistic efficient causes (including divine causes) in a dual world where they are invisible, but keep their effects in this world. On this analysis, Plantinga and Johnson are as naturalistic as their opponents in conceiving divine action, but because they are dualists, they are not naturalistic in quite the same way. © 2003, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

In contrast, it is argued that by acknowledging the (re)constructive nature of our religious life in an imaginative and technological culture, consonance becomes a constructive project rather than a descriptive claim. Plausibility is served better; it is claimed, by exploring religious options in relation to successes and limitations of a naturalistic understanding of the world than by advocating religious understanding as an alternative to such a naturalistic one. And the asymmetry of religion and science can be addressed fruitfully by considering carefully the character of theologies as ways of holding together, in tension perhaps, a cosmology and an axiology. © 2003, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

This essay traces some of the history of ideas about the nature of philosophy, and then proposes that in this post-analytic era philosophy can play both a constructive and critical role in the theology-science dialogue. The constructive role is well reflected in current literature so this essay explores the role of philosophy as therapy. As a test case the doctrine of critical realism is diagnosed as a theory designed to solve a problem that needs instead to be dissolved by recognizing that it is based on a misleading picture of the knower's relation to the world. © 2003, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.
